# MISS

MISS is a a nonlinear methodology based on mutual information for genetic association.

:::

The an information theoretic approach to genetic association, which has been integrated jointly with a feature selection algorithm. The algorithm was been tested on a synthetic data with a controlled phenotype and in the particular case of the F7 gene. This algorithm proposes a multi-target approach and unveils combinations of SNPs that explain more significant information of the phenotype than their individual polymorphisms.
