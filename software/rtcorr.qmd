# Description of the `HCor` R Package

The HCor package provides a set of functions for processing **Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS)** data, focusing on chromatogram drift correction, peak detection, and data normalization. It is designed to handle mass spectrometry chromatograms by adjusting retention times, correcting peak drift, and generating corrected chromatographic data.

---

## Key Functionalities
The package consists of various functions aimed at correcting chromatographic drifts, handling chromatographic files, and processing raw LC/MS data. Below are the core functionalities:

###  Chromatographic Data Handling
- `files2Matrix()`: Reads chromatographic data from external files (e.g., mzXML, CDF) and converts them into a matrix format.
- `printCDFfile()`: Writes corrected chromatographic data to new CDF files.
- `cdfFileCreator()`: Generates CDF files from processed chromatographic data.

### Chromatogram Drift Correction
- `corrDrift()`: Applies drift correction to raw chromatographic data by fitting a hyperbolic model to compensate for retention time shifts.
- `peakDrift()`: Computes peak drift for a given chromatographic peak and corrects retention time variability.
- `peakDrifts()`: Applies peakDrift() to multiple peaks for batch correction.

###  Peak Detection and Normalization
- `setAnchorPeaks()`: Selects anchor peaks for drift correction by allowing users to visually choose retention time intervals.
- `squares()`: Computes the sum of squares of deviations to optimize drift correction parameters.

### Processing of Corrected Data
- `peakDrifts()`: Computes drift corrections across multiple peaks and generates corrected chromatographic datasets.
- `cdfFileCreator()`: Outputs corrected chromatographic data to CDF files.

## How `HCor` Works
1. Load the package and input data (e.g., mzXML files).
2. Convert chromatographic data into a matrix format (`files2Matrix`).
3. Correct chromatographic drift by detecting and correcting peak shifts (`corrDrift`, `peakDrift`).
4. Optimize retention time alignment (`squares` function minimizes drift errors).
5. Generate corrected chromatographic files for further analysis (`printCDFfile`, `cdfFileCreator`).

## Use Case: Correcting Drift in LC/MS Data
```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(HCor)



# Convert mzXML chromatograms to matrix format
dataMatrix <- files2Matrix(dataDir = "path/to/mzXML/files")

# Set anchor peaks for drift correction
anchorPeaks <- setAnchorPeaks(dataMatrix, nAnchorPeaks = 3)

# Compute drift correction
correctedData <- corrDrift(chromatogramsMatrix = dataMatrix, peakDriftsList = anchorPeaks)

# Save corrected data as CDF files
cdfFileCreator(dataMatrix = correctedData, dir2print = "corrected_chromatograms", dataDir = "path/to/output")
```
