Chemosensors is an R Software tool that allows for the design of synthetic experiments with so-called virtual gas sensor arrays. The package was developed by Andrey Ziyatdinov and Alexandre Perera. This R package was a product of the Neurochem project, an 7FP Bio-ICT project focused on Bioengineering and bioinspired computing.

The R package and tutorial can be found [here](https://chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org).

## Installation From CRAN (Recommended)

The command in R to install the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("chemosensors")
```

The stable version of chemosensors package from the CRAN repository will be installed

## Installation From R-Forge

Chemosensors package can be installed as a regular R package from the R-Forge repository. The command to type in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("chemosensors", dep=TRUE, repos="http://r-forge.r-project.org")
```

That will install the latest development version with all dependencies. Please let us know if you have any problems related to installation or running the software.

## Documentation

Help pages in html format are available on <http://chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org/html>. Thanks to `devtools` and `staticdocs.`

## Examples

You might prefer to start with demos of the package. To see the list of available demos type in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
demo(package="chemosensors")
Basic commands to generate synthetic data from a virtual sensor array could be:
# concentration matrix of 3 gas classes: A, C and AC
conc <- matrix(0, 300, 3)
conc[1:100, 1] <- 0.05 # A
conc[101:200, 3] <- 1 # C
conc[201:300, 1] <- 0.05 # AC
conc[201:300, 3] <- 1 # AC

conc <- conc[sample(1:nrow(conc)  ), ]

# sensor array of 5 sensors with parametrized noise levels
sa <- SensorArray(num=1:5, csd=0.1, ssd=0.1, dsd=0.1)

# get information about the array
print(sa)
plot(sa)

# generate the data
sdata <- predict(sa, conc)

# plot the data
plot(sa, "prediction", conc=conc)
```
