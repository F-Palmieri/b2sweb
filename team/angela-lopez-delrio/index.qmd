Hi! I am a biomedical engineer (BSc from the Technical University of Madrid and MSc from the University of Barcelona/Polytechnic University of Catalonia). I did my PhD, advised by Dr. Alexandre Perera Lluna, at the B2SLab between 2017-2021.

It focused on ways to ensure the quality and reliability of deep learning models used to predict how proteins and compounds interact in the early stages of drug discovery.

During my PhD, I collaborated with the start-up Mind the Byte and did a research stay at Uniprot, in the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) in Cambridge, UK. Since 2020, I have been working as a Data Scientist at the pharma company Boehringer Ingelheim, first in R&D in Biberach (Germany) and now back in Barcelona, in the Business Operations department.
