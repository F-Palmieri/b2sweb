Welcome to my site! My name is Maria Barranco Altirriba and I hold a bachelor's and a master's degree in Biomedical Engineering in Universitat de Barcelona. I am currently doing (almost finishing!) a PhD in the [B2SLab](https://b2slab.upc.edu/), which is part of the Institut de Recerca i Innovació en Salut ([IRIS](https://iris.upc.edu/)), formerly the Research Center for Biomedical Engineering (CREB) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, in Barcelona.

My research focuses on metabolomics, including the development of new methods to analyse and interpret metabolomics data, such as the mWISE annotation algorithm. I also apply these tools to better understand diabetes mellitus and its complications. In a recent publication, we identified lipids significantly associated with subclinical carotid atherosclerosis in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Last year, I spent nine months at LipiTUM (Technical University of Munich), where I developed a language model (Smile-to-Bert) to generate embeddings for molecular SMILES. These pre-trained models can be used across datasets to predict molecular properties, an active area of research in drug discovery.
