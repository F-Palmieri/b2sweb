Hello! My name is Rafael León Carrasco. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Chemical Engineering and a Master’s in Interdisciplinary & Innovative Engineering by the UPC (Polytechnic University of Catalonia). I am an engineer passionate about technology and data science. My work focuses on developing Machine Learning models for diagnosing rare diseases, and collaborating closely with medical institutions such as Hospital Sant Joan de Déu and Hospital Sant Pau for data analysis. I specialize in using graph models and neural networks to extract insights from clinical data. Moreover I have programming and server management experience.

With a strong background in engineering and research experience, I enjoy facing complex challenges and finding efficient solutions. Additionally, I quickly adapt to new technological landscapes required.
