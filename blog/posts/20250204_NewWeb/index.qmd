## Welcome to our new website!!

:::


After a long time without updating ([although busy doing stuff](https://b2slab.upc.edu/publications/)) we have updated our site. The approach of the update of course is try to reduce the maintenance time and add interoperativity with the University bibliographic system at [futur](https://futur.upc.edu) so that our publication list is always updated (or more often updated). 

So now the website pulls the team info from the linked google spreadsheet and it also pulls the publications list from [futur.upc.edu](https://futur.upc.edu/B2SLab) at build.

 The website is coded with [quarto](https:/quarto.org). This means that it is essentially build with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). We thank the team of [posit.co](https://posit.co) and [quarto](https:/quarto.org) for building this nice tools. 
 
This is kind of following the philosophy of [org-mode](https://orgmode.org) which [Ã€lex](http://b2slab.upc.edu/team/alexandre-perera-lluna/) has been using for building slides and teaching material during the last years. This allows us to mix python/R and other code for building reports, papers and slides in a [reproducible approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) and [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). 

Thanks for reading!
