TI - Mediterranean diet is a predictor of progression of subclinical atherosclerosis in a mediterranean population: the ILERVAS prospective cohort study
AB - Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major health issue, often developing silently as subclinical atherosclerotic disease (SAD). The Mediterranean diet (MDiet) is known for its cardiovascular benefits, but the combined influence of both MDiet adherence and physical activity (PA) on SAD progression has not been previously documented. Objective: We aimed to investigate how adherence to a healthy lifestyle, defined as MDiet adherence and PA level, influences SAD progression in subjects from the ILERVAS cohort follow-up. Methods: A study on 3097 participants from the ILERVAS prospective cohort was conducted. MDiet adherence was assessed using the MEDAS score, and PA categories were established using the IPAQ, both categorized into low, moderate, and high levels. Two different lifestyle scores integrating the MDiet and PA categories were built. The presence of atherosclerotic plaques was assessed by carotid and femoral ultrasound examination. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were also obtained. Multivariable linear, logistic, and Poisson regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to analyze the association between the lifestyle scores and SAD progression, as well as the MDiet and PA as separate variables and number of territories with plaque. Results: A healthier lifestyle score did not show an effect on SAD progression. However, a higher MEDAS score was associated with a 3% decrease in the number of territories with plaque (IRR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.99, p < 0.001), suggesting a protective effect of the adherence to the MDiet. PA did not show a significant association (IRR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00, p = 0.269). Older age, hypertension, dyslipidemia, smoking, and lower eGFR were associated with SAD progression, while the female sex was protective (IRR 0.67, 95% CI 0.63-0.72, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The findings of this study show that higher adherence to the MDiet is associated with reduced incidence of SAD, indicating its potential role in cardiovascular prevention strategies. Although a higher lifestyle score or physical activity levels did not show any significant effect, promoting the MDiet, alongside managing traditional cardiovascular risk factors, could be an effective public health intervention to prevent atherosclerosis and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease.

TI - Cerebrospinal fluid homovanillic and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acids in a large pediatric population; establishment of reference intervals and impact of disease and medication
AB - Background Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) homovanillic (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acids (5-HIAA) are biomarkers of neurological diseases affecting the dopaminergic and serotoninergic pathways. Establishing reference intervals for these metabolites faces the challenges of a lack of healthy controls and a negative correlation with age, making stratified intervals unrealistic. We propose a pipeline to determine continuous reference intervals for HVA and 5-HIAA using an indirect method. We also studied the confounding effects of different variables and explored the impact of antiepileptic and neuroleptic treatments on HVA and 5-HIAA values. Methods The study used least squares regression to fit age-concentration curves from a cohort of pediatric patients (n = 1533), where the residuals represent metabolite values excluding age effect. Presuming that HVA and 5-HIAA primary deficiencies characterize a distinct subpopulation, we fitted a two-component finite mixture model in age-normalized data and set reference intervals at the central 95% of the nondeficient population. Results Patients with primary genetic deficiencies of HVA and/or 5-HIAA consistently fall outside the proposed continuous reference intervals. Using the new continuous reference intervals reduces the number of secondary deficiencies detected compared with using stratified values. No correlations were observed between CSF HVA and 5-HIAA values across the studied drug categories (antiseizure and neuroleptic medications). In addition, biopterin values positively influenced both metabolite concentrations. Conclusion The proposed continuous reference intervals caused a substantial reduction in the number of secondary deficiencies detected, most of which demonstrated no conclusive correlations between the diseases and altered HVA and 5-HIAA values.

TI - Factors affecting disease progression in individuals with heterozygous COL4A3/COL4A4 pathogenic variants
AB - Abstract Background and Aims Individuals with heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL4A3/COL4A4 or also known as autosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) are increasingly diagnosed and show a wide spectrum of disease. Factors contributing to these different outcomes are not well understood. Here we study a cohort of patients with pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in COL4A3/COL4A4 with slow and rapid progression to evaluate risk factors associated with the condition. Method A retrospective observational multicenter study was performed in a cohort of individuals with heterozygous P and LP in COL4A3/COL4A4. Criteria were established to classify patients into rapid (RP) and slow progression (SP) (Fig. 1). In this study, we compared both cohorts and identified risk factors of rapid progression using T-score for numeric variables or Chi square for categoric variables. For the numerical variables that were correlated with RP, a cut-off point was established fitting the data with a regression curve. Further analyses are ongoing. Results A total of 374 patients were studied, the progression of the disease was classified in 135 individuals: 82 with RP (60.7%) and 53 SP (39.3%). The remaining patients couldn't be classified due to age or missing data during follow-up. The mean age at diagnosis of classified patients was 46.61 years (SD 17.46), with 65% being women. Genetic variant distribution was COL4A3 38%, COL4A4 58%, and digenic 4%. At diagnosis, 72% of patients had albuminuria or proteinuria (mean age of diagnosis: 50 years). Among these, 52.7% had ACR or PCR greater than 300 or 500 mg/gCr, with mean ACR at 445.92 mg/gCr (SD 587.54, max 2240 mg/g) and mean PCR at 968.38 (SD 1422, max 10633). 94% individuals had hematuria (mean age at diagnosis: 36.27 years). Forty-nine patients (36%) had CKD G-5, with a mean age of diagnosis of 53.08 years (SD 12.42). The mean eGFR was 67.56 (SD 30.56 ml/min). Results of kidney biopsy were available for 51 patients. 73 individuals had hypertension (HTN) with a mean age at diagnosis of 46.30 years (SD 13.81). A total of 82 patients responded to personal habits questionnaire. With all the variables studied, a total of 4 main variables were associated with RP. - Presence of albuminuria or proteinuria measured by ACR (>300 mg/gCr) or PCR at diagnosis or during follow-up (>500 mg/gCr) (p < 0.001). - Age at diagnosis of HTN (p < 0.0001) establishing a cut-off point at 40 years (R2 0.85) - Age at diagnosis of the condition (p = 0.0046) establishing a cutoff point of 42 years (R2 0.61) - Years of smoking (p = 0.009) with a cut-off point 11.8 years (R2 0.72) The main variables associated with a worse outcome in individuals with heterozygous pathogenic variants in COL4A3/COL4A4 is the presence of albuminuria/proteinuria, HTN, age at diagnosis of HTN and age at diagnosis of the disease. Smoking has also been associated with a worse outcome when an exposure time over 11.8 years. More studies are still needed to understand the reasons for the huge phenotypic variability of this condition.

TI - The dilemma of variables assumptions in thermal comfort calculations for educational buildings: to simplify or not?
AB - Thermal comfort is crucial for people well-being and productivity in buildings, and it has a strong effect on building's energy usage. The main models for assessing thermal comfort, like predictive mean vote (PMV) and adaptive models, need many environmental measurements, making monitoring complex. That has sparked a debate: some advocate reducing the number of variables, while others stress sticking to the original models. This article evaluates current research trends and addresses the limitations of globe sensors, the most commonly used instrument for measuring mean radiant temperature. To address these is- sues, the study conducts a sensitivity analysis using latin hypercube sampling with multidimen- sional uniformity and employs data from 41 measurements conducted in educational buildings spanning different academic levels, from preschool to university. This analysis examines various simplifications in the measuring procedures for the PMV and adaptive models proposed by ASHRAE 55, ISO 7730 and EN 16798. For this purpose, two mean radiant temperature accuracies are used according to the minimum requirement and the desired value specified by ISO 7726, +/-2 ?C and +/-0.2 ? C respectively. The results suggest that models with fewer variables tend to overestimate thermal comfort levels. However, this models are valid as their estimations fall within the uncertainty range of the complete model, as long as the mean radiant temperature accuracy is +/-2 ?C as achieved with globe sensors. When mean radiant temperature accuracy improves (i.e. +/-0.2 ?C), the outcome of the models with less variables imply an overestimation falling out of the uncertainty of the complete model.

TI - Lipidome characterisation and sex-specific differences in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus
AB - Background: In this study, we evaluated the lipidome alterations caused by type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), by determining lipids significantly associated with diabetes overall and in both sexes, and lipids associated with the glycaemic state. Methods: An untargeted lipidomic analysis was performed to measure the lipid profiles of 360 subjects (91 T1D, 91 T2D, 74 with prediabetes and 104 controls (CT)) without cardiovascular and/or chronic kidney disease. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS) was conducted in two ion modes (positive and negative). We used multiple linear regression models to (1) assess the association between each lipid feature and each condition, (2) determine sex-specific differences related to diabetes, and (3) identify lipids associated with the glycaemic state by considering the prediabetes stage. The models were adjusted by sex, age, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, body mass index, glucose, smoking, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, alternate Mediterranean diet score (aMED) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); diabetes duration and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) were also included in the comparison between T1D and T2D. Results: A total of 54 unique lipid subspecies from 15 unique lipid classes were annotated. Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) and ceramides (Cer) showed opposite effects in subjects with T1D and subjects with T2D, LPCs being mainly up-regulated in T1D and down-regulated in T2D, and Cer being up-regulated in T2D and down-regulated in T1D. Also, Phosphatidylcholines were clearly down-regulated in subjects with T1D. Regarding sex-specific differences, ceramides and phosphatidylcholines exhibited important diabetes-associated differences due to sex. Concerning the glycaemic state, we found a gradual increase of a panel of 1-deoxyceramides from normoglycemia to prediabetes to T2D. Conclusions: Our findings revealed an extensive disruption of lipid metabolism in both T1D and T2D. Additionally, we found sex-specific lipidome changes associated with diabetes, and lipids associated with the glycaemic state that can be linked to previously described molecular mechanisms in diabetes.

TI - Use of enzymatically converted cell-free DNA (cfDNA) data for copy number variation-linked fragmentation analysis allows for early colorectal cancer detection
AB - The use of non-invasive liquid biopsy-based cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis is an emerging method of cancer detection and intervention. Different analytical methodologies are used to investigate cfDNA characteristics, resulting in costly and long analysis processes needed for combining different data. This study investigates the possibility of using cfDNA data converted for methylation analysis for combining the cfDNA fragment size with copy number variation (CNV) in the context of early colorectal cancer detection. Specifically, we focused on comparing enzymatically and bisulfite-converted data for evaluating cfDNA fragments belonging to chromosome 18. Chromosome 18 is often reported to be deleted in colorectal cancer. We used counts of short and medium cfDNA fragments of chromosome 18 and trained a linear model (LDA) on a set of 2959 regions to predict early-stage (I-IIA) colorectal cancer on an independent test set. In total, 87.5% sensitivity and 92% specificity were obtained on the enzymatically converted libraries. Repeating the same workflow on bisulfite-converted data yielded lower accuracy results with 58.3% sensitivity, implying that enzymatic conversion preserves the cancer fragmentation footprint in whole genome data better than bisulfite conversion. These results could serve as a promising new avenue for the early detection of colorectal cancer using fragmentation and methylation approaches on the same datasets.

TI - Intrinsic functional brain connectivity changes following aerobic exercise, computerized cognitive training, and their combination in physically inactive healthy late-middle-aged adults: the Projecte Moviment
AB - Lifestyle interventions have positive neuroprotective effects in aging. However, there are still open questions about how changes in resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) contribute to cognitive improvements. The Projecte Moviment is a 12-week randomized controlled trial of a multimodal data acquisition protocol that investigated the effects of aerobic exercise (AE), computerized cognitive training (CCT), and their combination (COMB). An initial list of 109 participants was recruited from which a total of 82 participants (62% female; age?=?58.38?+/-?5.47) finished the intervention with a level of adherence?>?80%. Only in the COMB group, we revealed an extended network of 33 connections that involved an increased and decreased rsFC within and between the aDMN/pDMN and a reduced rsFC between the bilateral supplementary motor areas and the right thalamus. No global and especially local rsFC changes due to any intervention mediated the cognitive benefits detected in the AE and COMB groups. Projecte Moviment provides evidence of the clinical relevance of lifestyle interventions and the potential benefits when combining them.

TI - Home monitoring for older singles: A gas sensor array system
AB - Many residential environments have been equipped with sensing technologies both to provide assistance to older people who have opted for aging-in-place and to provide information to caregivers and family. However, such technologies are often accompanied by physical discomfort, privacy concerns, and complexity of use. We explored the feasibility of monitoring home activity using chemical sensors that pose fewer privacy concerns than, for example, video-cameras and which do not suffer from blind spots. We built a monitoring device that integrates a sensor array and IoT capabilities to gather the necessary data about a resident in his/her living space. Over a period of 3 months, we uninterruptedly measured the living space of a typical elder person living on his/her own. To record the level of activity during the same period and obtain a ground truth for the activity, a set of motion sensors were also deployed in the house. Home activity was extracted from a PCA space moving-window which translated sensor data into the event space; this also compensated for environmental and sensor drift. Our results show that it is possible to monitor the person's home activity and detect sudden deviations from it using a low-cost, non-invasive, system based on gas sensors that gather data on the air composition in the living space. We made the dataset publicly available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php2.

TI - EpiGe: A machine-learning strategy for rapid classification of medulloblastoma using PCR-based methyl-genotyping
AB - Molecular classification of medulloblastoma is critical for the treatment of this brain tumor. Array-based DNA methylation profiling has emerged as a powerful approach for brain tumor classification. However, this technology is currently not widely available. We present a machine-learning decision support system (DSS) that enables the classification of the principal molecular groups-WNT, SHH, and non-WNT/non-SHH-directly from quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. We propose a framework where the developed DSS appears as a user-friendly web-application-EpiGe-App-that enables automated interpretation of qPCR methylation data and subsequent molecular group prediction. The basis of our classification strategy is a previously validated six-cytosine signature with subgroup-specific methylation profiles.

TI - Canine-inspired unidirectional flows for improving memory effects in machine olfaction
AB - A dog's nose differs from a human's in that air does not change direction but flows in a unidirectional path from inlet to outlet. Previous simulations showed that unidirectional flow through a dog's complex nasal passageways creates stagnant zones of trapped air. We hypothesize that these zones give the dog a "physical memory," which it may use to compare recent odors to past ones. In this study, we conducted experiments with our previously built Gaseous Recognition Oscillatory Machine Integrating Technology (GROMIT) and performed corresponding simulations in two dimensions. We compared three settings: a control setting that mimics the bidirectional flow of the human nose; a short-circuit setting where odors exit before reaching the sensors; and a unidirectional configuration using a dedicated inlet and outlet that mimics the dog's nose. After exposure to odors, the sensors in the unidirectional setting showed the slowest return to their baseline level, indicative of memory effects. Simulations showed that both short-circuit and unidirectional flows created trapped recirculation zones, which slowed the release of odors from the chamber. In the future, memory effects such as the ones found here may improve the sensitivity and utility of electronic noses.

TI - Mapping layperson medical terminology into the Human Phenotype Ontology using neural machine translation models
AB - In the medical domain there exists a terminological gap between patients and caregivers and the healthcare professionals. This gap may hinder the success of the communication between healthcare consumers and professionals in the field, with negative emotional and clinical consequences. In this work, we build a machine learning-based tool for the automatic translation between the terminology used by laypeople and that of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). HPO is a structured vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities found in human disease. Our method uses a vector space to represent an HPO-specific embedding as the output space for a neural network model trained on vector representations of layperson versions and other textual descriptors of medical terms. We explored different output embeddings coupled to different neural network architectures for the machine translation stage. We compute a similarity measure to evaluate the ability of the model to assign an HPO term to a layperson input. The best-performing models resulted with a similarity higher than 0.7 for more than 80% of the terms, with a median between 0.98 and 1. The translator model is made available in a web application at this link: https://hpotranslator.b2slab.upc.edu.

TI - Longitudinal deep learning clustering of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus trajectories using routinely collected health records
AB - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly heterogeneous chronic disease with different pathophysiological and genetic characteristics affecting its progression, associated complications and response to therapies. The advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the availability of a large amount of healthcare data allow us to investigate T2DM characteristics and evolution with a completely new approach, studying common disease trajectories rather than cross sectional values. We used an Kernelized-AutoEncoder algorithm to map 5 years of data of 11,028 subjects diagnosed with T2DM in a latent space that embedded similarities and differences between patients in terms of the evolution of the disease. Once we obtained the latent space, we used classical clustering algorithms to create longitudinal clusters representing different evolutions of the diabetic disease. Our unsupervised DL clustering algorithm suggested seven different longitudinal clusters. Different mean ages were observed among the clusters (ranging from 65.3+/-11.6 to 72.8+/-9.4). Subjects in clusters B (Hypercholesteraemic) and E (Hypertensive) had shorter diabetes duration (9.2+/-3.9 and 9.5+/-3.9 years respectively). Subjects in Cluster G (Metabolic) had the poorest glycaemic control (mean glycated hemoglobin 7.99+/-1.42%), while cluster E had the best one (mean glycated hemoglobin 7.04+/-1.11%). Obesity was observed mainly in clusters A (Neuropathic), C (Multiple Complications), F (Retinopathy) and G. A dashboard is available at dm2.b2slab.upc.edu to visualize the different trajectories corresponding to the 7 clusters.

TI - Use of metal oxide semiconductor sensors to measure methane in aquatic ecosystems in the presence of cross-interfering compounds
AB - Monitoring dissolved methane in aquatic ecosystems contributes significantly to advancing our understanding of the carbon cycle in these habitats and capturing their impact on methane emissions. Low-cost metal oxide semiconductors (MOS) gas sensors are becoming an increasingly attractive tool to perform such measurements, especially at the air-water interface. However, the performance of MOS sensors in aquatic environmental sciences has come under scrutiny because of their cross-sensitivity to temperature, moisture, and sulfide interference. In this study, we evaluated the performance and limitations of a MOS methane sensor when measuring dissolved methane in waters. A MOS sensor was encapsulated in a hydrophobic extended polytetrafluoroethylene membrane to impede contact with water but allow gas perfusion. Therefore, the membrane enabled us to submerge the sensor in water and overcome cross-sensitivity to humidity. A simple portable, low-energy, flow-through cell system was assembled that included an encapsulated MOS sensor and a temperature sensor. Waters (with or without methane) were injected into the flow cell at a constant rate by a peristaltic pump. The signals from the two sensors were recorded continuously with a cost-efficient microcontroller. Tests specifically focused on the effect of water temperature and sulfide interference on sensor performance. Our experiments revealed that the lower limit of the sensor was in the range of 0.1-0.2 umol?L-1 and that it provided a stable response at water temperatures in the range of 18.5-28^0C. Dissolved sulfide at a concentration of 0.4?mmol?L-1 or higher interfered with the sensor response, especially at low methane concentrations (0.5 umol?L-1 or lower). However, we show that if dissolved sulfide is monitored, its interference can be alleviated.

AB - Metabolomics is the latest of the omics sciences. It attempts to measure and characterize metabolites-small chemical compounds <1500 Da-on cells, tissue, or biofluids, which are usually products of biological reactions. As metabolic reactions are closer to the phenotype, metabolomics has emerged as an attractive science for various areas of research, including personalized medicine. However, due to the complexity of data obtained and the absence of curated databases for metabolite identification, data processing is the major bottleneck in this area since most technicians lack the required bioinformatics expertise to process datasets in a reliable and fast manner. The aim of this chapter is to describe the available tools for data processing that makes an inexperienced researcher capable of obtaining reliable results without having to undergo through huge parametrization steps.

TI - Assessing rheoencephalography dynamics through analysis of the interactions among brain and cardiac networks during general anesthesia
AB - Cerebral blood flow (CBF) reflects the rate of delivery of arterial blood to the brain. Since no nutrients, oxygen or water can be stored in the cranial cavity due to space and pressure restrictions, a continuous perfusion of the brain is critical for survival. Anesthetic procedures are known to affect cerebral hemodynamics, but CBF is only monitored in critical patients due, among others, to the lack of a continuous and affordable bedside monitor for this purpose. A potential solution through bioelectrical impedance technology, also known as rheoencephalography (REG), is proposed, that could fill the existing gap for a low-cost and effective CBF monitoring tool. The underlying hypothesis is that REG signals carry information on CBF that might be recovered by means of the application of advanced signal processing techniques, allowing to track CBF alterations during anesthetic procedures. The analysis of REG signals was based on geometric features extracted from the time domain in the first place, since this is the standard processing strategy for this type of physiological data. Geometric features were tested to distinguish between different anesthetic depths, and they proved to be capable of tracking cerebral hemodynamic changes during anesthesia. Furthermore, an approach based on Poincar'e plot features was proposed, where the reconstructed attractors form REG signals showed significant differences between different anesthetic states. This was a key finding, providing an alternative to standard processing of REG signals and supporting the hypothesis that REG signals do carry CBF information. Furthermore, the analysis of cerebral hemodynamics during anesthetic procedures was performed by means of studying causal relationships between global hemodynamics, cerebral hemodynamics and electroencephalogram (EEG) based-parameters. Interactions were detected during anesthetic drug infusion and patient positioning (Trendelenburg positioning and passive leg raise), providing evidence of the causal coupling between hemodynamics and brain activity. The provided alternative of REG signal processing confirmed the hypothesis that REG signals carry information on CBF. The simplicity of the technology, together with its low cost and easily interpretable outcomes, should provide a new opportunity for REG to reach standard clinical practice. Moreover, causal relationships among the hemodynamic physiological signals and brain activity were assessed, suggesting that the inclusion of REG information in depth of anesthesia monitors could be of valuable use to prevent unwanted CBF alterations during anesthetic procedures.

TI - Drift in a popular metal oxide sensor dataset reveals limitations for gas classification benchmarks
AB - Metal oxide (MOx) gas sensors are a popular choice for many applications, due to their tunable sensitivity, space efficiency and low cost. Publicly available sensor datasets are particularly valuable for the research community as they accelerate the development and evaluation of novel algorithms for gas sensor data analysis. A dataset published in 2013 by Vergara and colleagues contains recordings from MOx gas sensor arrays in a wind tunnel. It has since become a standard benchmark in the field. Here we report a latent property of this dataset that limits its suitability for gas classification studies. Measurement timestamps show that gases were recorded in separate, temporally clustered batches. Sensor baseline response before gas exposure were strongly correlated with the recording batch, to the extent that baseline response was largely sufficient to infer the gas used in a given trial. Zero-offset baseline compensation did not resolve the issue, since residual short-term drift still contained enough information for gas/trial identification using a machine learning classifier. A subset of the data recorded within a short period of time was minimally affected by drift and suitable for gas classification benchmarking after offset- compensation, but with much reduced classification performance compared to the full dataset. We found 18 publications where this dataset was used without precautions against the circumstances we describe, thus potentially overestimating the accuracy of gas classification algorithms. These observations highlight potential pitfalls in using previously recorded gas sensor data, which may have distorted widely reported results

TI - ss2-adrenergic stimulation potentiates spontaneous calcium release by increasing signal mass and co-activation of ryanodine receptor clusters
AB - Aims

It is unknown how ss-adrenergic stimulation affects calcium dynamics in individual RyR2 clusters and leads to the induction of spontaneous calcium waves. To address this, we analysed spontaneous calcium release events in green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged RyR2 clusters.
Methods

Cardiomyocytes from mice with GFP-tagged RyR2 or human right atrial tissue were subjected to immunofluorescent labelling or confocal calcium imaging.
Results

Spontaneous calcium release from single RyR2 clusters induced 91.4% +/- 2.0% of all calcium sparks while 8.0% +/- 1.6% were caused by release from two neighbouring clusters. Sparks with two RyR2 clusters had 40% bigger amplitude, were 26% wider, and lasted 35% longer at half maximum. Consequently, the spark mass was larger in two- than one-cluster sparks with a median and interquartile range for the cumulative distribution of 15.7 +/- 20.1 vs 7.6 +/- 5.7 a.u. (P < .01). ss2-adrenergic stimulation increased RyR2 phosphorylation at s2809 and s2815, tripled the fraction of two- and three-cluster sparks, and significantly increased the spark mass. Interestingly, the amplitude and mass of the calcium released from a RyR2 cluster were proportional to the SR calcium load, but the firing rate was not. The spark mass was also higher in 33 patients with atrial fibrillation than in 36 without (22.9 +/- 23.4 a.u. vs 10.7 +/- 10.9; P = .015).
Conclusions

Most sparks are caused by activation of a single RyR2 cluster at baseline while ss-adrenergic stimulation doubles the mass and the number of clusters per spark. This mimics the shift in the cumulative spark mass distribution observed in myocytes from patients with atrial fibrillation.

TI - Weighted time warping improves T-wave morphology markers clinical significance
AB - Background: T-wave (TW) morphology indices based on time-warping (dw) have shown significant cardiovascular risk stratification value. However, errors in the location of TW boundaries may impact their prognostic power. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a weighted time-warping function (WF) would reduce the sensitivity of dw to these errors and improve their clinical significance. Methods: The WFs were proportional to (i) the reference TW (T), and (ii) the absolute value of its derivative (D). The index dw was recalculated using these WFs, and its performance was compared to the unweighted control case (C) in four different scenarios: 1) robustness against simulated TW boundaries location errors; 2) ability to retain physiological information in an electrophysiological cardiac model; 3) ability to monitor blood potassium concentration changes ([K+]) in 29 hemodialysis (HD) patients; 4) and the sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification value of the TW morphology restitution (TMR) index, derived from dw, in 651 chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Results and Discussion: The WFs led to a reduced sensitivity (R) of dw to TW boundary location errors as compared to C (median R=0.19 and 0.22 and 0.35 for T, D and C, respectively). They also preserved the physiological relationship between dw and repolarization dispersion changes at ventricular level. No improvements in [K+] tracking were observed for the HD patients (Pearsons median correlation [r] between [K+] and dw was 0.86r0.90 for T, D and C). In CHF patients, the SCD risk stratification value of TMR was improved by applying T (hazard ratio, HAR, of 2.80), followed by D (HAR=2.32) and C (HAR=2.23). Conclusions and Significance: The proposed WFs, with T showing the best performance, increased the robustness of time-warping based markers against TW location errors preserving their physiological information content and boosting their SCD risk stratification value. Results from this work support the use of T when deriving dw for future clinical applications.

TI - COVID-19 impact on maritime traffic and corresponding pollutant emissions. The case of the Port of Barcelona
AB - The impact of the SARS-CoV pandemic has gone well beyond health concerns, reaching the maritime industry. The study on the environmental impact of shipping industry during COVID-19 pandemic can provide useful insights to propose new management policies regarding shipping operations, both in-port and on the route. We present a case study centred in the Port of Barcelona covering a 30 nautical miles range in the period March to July 2020, during which different levels of restrictions and stringent lockdown measures were enforced. In this paper, we assess the impact of COVID-19 on maritime traffic and its related emissions in port cities using real-time Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. Interestingly, results show that the decline in maritime traffic is not correlated with a decrease in maritime emissions due to changes in vessel operation. During lockdown (March to June 2020), we observed a 27.9% reduction in the number of port calls compared to the pre-lockdown scenario, whereas pollutant emissions show a moderate decrease (1.8% for CO2), no significant reduction (SO2 and PM) or a slight increase (1.3% for NOx). This can be directly assigned to changes in vessel operation mode, i.e. vessels switched from Underway to At Anchor or Moored status, during which auxiliary engines are used at higher loads.

TI - #CoronavirusCruise: Impact and implications of the COVID-19 outbreaks on the perception of cruise tourism
AB - Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Diamond Princess became the center of the largest outbreak outside the original epicenter in China. This outbreak which left 712 passengers infected and 14 dead, followed by subsequent outbreaks affecting over one-third of the active ships in the cruise industry's global fleet, quickly became a crisis that captured public attention and dominated mainstream news and social media. This study investigates the perception of cruising during these outbreaks by analyzing the tweets on cruising using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The findings show a prevalent negative sentiment in most of the analyzed tweets, while the criticisms directed at the cruise industry were based on perceptions and stereotypes of the industry before the pandemic. The study provides insight into the concerns raised in these conversations and highlights the need for new business models outside the pre-pandemic mass-market model and to genuinely make cruising more environmentally friendly.

TI - Early fire detection based on gas sensor arrays: Multivariate calibration and validation
AB - Smoldering fires are characterized by the production of early gas emissions that can include high levels of CO and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) due to pyrolysis or thermal degradation. Nowadays, standalone CO sensors, smoke detectors, or a combination of these, are standard components for fire alarm systems. While gas sensor arrays together with pattern recognition techniques are a valuable alternative for early fire detection, in practice they have certain drawbacks-they can detect early gas emissions, but can show low immunity to nuisances, and sensor time drift can render calibration models obsolete. In this work, we explore the performance of a gas sensor array for detecting smoldering and plastic fires while ensuring the rejection of a set of nuisances. We conducted variety of fire and nuisance experiments in a validated standard fire room (240 m3). Using PLS-DA and SVM, we evaluate the performance of different multivariate calibration models for this dataset. We show that calibration models remain predictive after several months, but perfect performance is not achieved. For example, 4 months after calibration, a PLS-DA model provides 100% specificity and 85% sensitivity since the system has difficulties in detecting plastic fires, whose signatures are close to nuisance scenarios. Nevertheless, our results show that systems based on gas sensor arrays are able to provide faster fire alarm response than conventional smoke-based fire alarms. We also propose the use of small-scale fire experiments to increase the number of calibration con- ditions at a reduced cost. Our results show that this is an effective way to increase the performance of the model, even when evaluated on a standard fire room. Finally, the acquired datasets are made publicly available to the community (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.5643074).

Correct system operation involves those activities and novel methodologies to detect, classify, and isolate faults and failures and model and simulate processes with predictive algorithms and analytics (using data analysis and asset condition to plan and perform activities). In this paper, we showcase the application of a complex-adaptive, self-organizing modeling method, and Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBNs), as a way towards the understanding of the dynamics of smart grid devices, and to model and characterize their behavior. This work demonstrates that PBNs are equivalent to the standard Reinforcement Learning Cycle, in which the agent/model has an interaction with its environment and receives feedback from it in the form of a reward signal. Different reward structures were created to characterize preferred behavior. This information can be used to guide the PBN to avoid fault conditions and failures.

TI - Sniffing speeds up chemical detection by controlling air-flows near sensors
AB - Most mammals sniff to detect odors, but little is known how the periodic inhale and exhale that make up a sniff helps to improve odor detection. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we use fluid mechanics and machine olfaction to rationalize the benefits of sniffing at different rates. We design and build a bellows and sensor system to detect the change in current as a function of odor concentration. A fast sniff enables quick odor recognition, but too fast a sniff makes the amplitude of the signal comparable to noise. A slow sniff increases signal amplitude but delays its transmission. This trade-off may inspire the design of future devices that can actively modulate their sniffing frequency according to different odors.

TI - How did the COVID-19 lockdown affect children and adolescent's well-being: Spanish parents, children, and adolescents respond
AB - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown strategies have been widely used to contain SARS-CoV-2 virus spread. Children and adolescents are especially vulnerable to suffering psychological effects as result of such measures. In Spain, children were enforced to a strict home lockdown for 42 days during the first wave. Here, we studied the effects of lockdown in children and adolescents through an online questionnaire. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Spain using an open online survey from July (after the lockdown resulting from the first pandemic wave) to November 2020 (second wave). We included families with children under 16 years-old living in Spain. Parents answered a survey regarding the lockdown effects on their children and were instructed to invite their children from 7 to 16 years-old (mandatory scholar age in Spain) to respond a specific set of questions. Answers were collected through an application programming interface system, and data analysis was performed using R. Results: We included 1,957 families who completed the questionnaires, covering a total of 3,347 children. The specific children's questionnaire was completed by 167 kids (7-11 years-old), and 100 adolescents (12-16 years-old). Children, in general, showed high resilience and capability to adapt to new situations. Sleeping problems were reported in more than half of the children (54%) and adolescents (59%), and these were strongly associated with less time doing sports and spending more than 5 h per day using electronic devices. Parents perceived their children to gain weight (41%), be more irritable and anxious (63%) and sadder (46%). Parents and children differed significantly when evaluating children's sleeping disturbances. Conclusions: Enforced lockdown measures and isolation can have a negative impact on children and adolescent's mental health and well-being. In future waves of the current pandemic, or in the light of potential epidemics of new emerging infections, lockdown measures targeting children, and adolescents should be reconsidered taking into account their infectiousness potential and their age-specific needs, especially to facilitate physical activity and to limit time spent on electronic devices.

TI - mWISE: an algorithm for context-based annotation of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry features through diffusion in graphs
AB - Untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) allows the detection of thousands of metabolites in biological samples. However, LC-MS data annotation is still considered a major bottleneck in the metabolomics pipeline since only a small fraction of the metabolites present in the sample can be annotated with the required confidence level. Here, we introduce mWISE (metabolomics wise inference of speck entities), an R package for context-based annotation of LC-MS data. The algorithm consists of three main steps aimed at (i) matching mass-to-charge ratio values to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, (ii) clustering and filtering the potential KEGG candidates, and (iii) building a final prioritized list using diffusion in graphs. The algorithm performance is evaluated with three publicly available studies using both positive and negative ionization modes. We have also compared mWISE to other available annotation algorithms in terms of their performance and computation time. In particular, we explored four different configurations for mWISE, and all four of them outperform xMSannotator (a state-of-the-art annotator) in terms of both performance and computation time. Using a diffusion configuration that combines the biological network obtained from the FELLA R package and raw scores, mWISE shows a sensitivity mean (standard deviation) across data sets of 0.63 (0.07), while xMSannotator achieves a sensitivity of 0.55 (0.19). We have also shown that the chemical structures of the compounds proposed by mWISE are closer to the original compounds than those proposed by xMSannotator. Finally, we explore the diffusion prioritization separately, showing its key role in the annotation process. mWISE is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/b2slab/mWISE) under a GPL license.

TI - ECG-based monitoring of blood potassium concentration: Periodic versus principal component as lead transformation for biomarker robustness
AB - Objective: The aim of this study is to compare the performance of two electrocardiogram (ECG) lead-space reduction (LSR) techniques in generating a transformed ECG lead from which T-wave morphology markers can be reliably derived to non-invasively monitor blood potassium concentration ([K+]) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). These LSR techniques are: (1) principal component analysis (PCA), learned on the T wave, and (2) periodic component analysis (pCA), either learned on the whole QRST complex (pCB) or on the T wave (pCT). We hypothesized pCA is less sensitive to non-periodic disturbances, like noise and body position changes (BPC), than PCA, thus leading to more reliable T wave morphology markers. Methods: We compared the ability of T wave morphology markers obtained from PCA, pCB and pCT in tracking [K+]in an ESRD-HD dataset, including 29 patients, during and after HD (evaluated by correlation and residual fitting error analysis). We also studied their robustness to BPC using an annotated database, including 20 healthy individuals, as well as to different levels of noise using a simulation set-up (assessed by means of Mann-Whitney U test and relative error, respectively). Results: The performance of both pCB and pCT-based markers in following [K+]-variations during HD was com-parable, and superior to that from PCA-based markers. Moreover, pCT-based markers showed superior robustness against BPC and noise. Conclusion: Both pCB and pCT outperform PCA in terms of monitoring [K+]in ESRD-HD patients, as well as of robustness against BPC and low SNR, with pCT showing the highest stability for continuous post-HD monitoring. Significance: The usage of pCA (i) increases the accuracy in monitoring dynamic [K+]variations in ESRD-HD patients and (ii) reduces the sensitivity to BPC and noise in deriving T wave morphology markers.

TI - Accurate early-stage colorectal cancer detection through analysis of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) methylation patterns.
AB - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs suffer from poor uptake and biomarkers have limited diagnostic accuracy. The measurement of the methylation status of tumor-derived cell-free DNA in plasma may address these challenges. We used a targeted methylation panel, tumor-derived signal deduction and machine learning algorithm to refine a blood test for the detection of early-stage CRC. Methods: This was a prospective, international multicenter observational cohort study. Plasma samples were collected either prior to a scheduled colonoscopy as part of standard colorectal cancer screening or prior to colonic surgery for primary CRC. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were initially selected by analyzing CRC and control tissue samples with whole genome bisulfite sequencing. A targeted sequencing assay was designed to capture these DMRs in plasma ctDNA. Individual sequencing reads were evaluated for cancer-specific methylation signal and scores calculated for each DMR in a sample. A panel of methylation scores originating from 203 DMRs was used in a prediction model building and validated in a test cohort of patients. Results: Calculated scores were used to train a machine learning model on 68 ctDNA samples from 18 early stage (I-II) and 16 late-stage (III-IV) CRC patients and 34 age, BMI, gender and country of origin matched neoplasia-free controls (median age 63 [50-74], mean BMI 27 [19.5-37], female 50%, Spanish and Ukrainian population, distal cancers 50%). This model was then applied to an independent set of subjects from Spanish, Ukraine and Germany, including 36 stage I-IV cancer patients (median age 61.5 [55-82], BMI 28 [16-39], female 47%, 42% of the tumors were distal) and 159 age and sex matched controls. 87 of the control patients had a negative colonoscopy finding (cNEG), 19 had hyperplastic polyps (HP), 37 had small non-advanced adenomas (NAA) and 16 were diagnosed with other benign gastrointestinal diseases (GID). The model correctly classified 92% (33/36) of CRC patients. Sensitivity per cancer stage ranged from 83% (5/6) for stage I, 92% (11/12) for stage II, 92% (12/13) for stage III to 100% (5/5) for stage IV. Specificity of the model was 97% (154/159), with 100% (37/37) NAA, 94% (15/16) GID, 95% (18/19) HP and 97% cNEG patients correctly identified. Lesion location, gender, BMI, age and country of origin were not significantly correlated to prediction outcome. Conclusions: Methylation sequencing data analyzed using read-wise scoring approach combined with a machine-learning algorithm is highly diagnostic for early-stage (I-II) CRCs (89% sensitivity at 97% specificity). This method could serve as the basis for a highly accurate and minimally invasive blood-based CRC screening test with significant implications for the clinical utility of ctDNA in early-stage cancer detection.

TI - Nonlinear T-wave time warping-based sensing model for non-invasive personalised blood potassium monitoring in hemodialysis patients: a pilot study
AB - Background: End-stage renal disease patients undergoing hemodialysis (ESRD-HD) therapy are highly susceptible to malignant ventricular arrhythmias caused by undetected potassium concentration ([K+]) variations (?[K+]) out of normal ranges. Therefore, a reliable method for continuous, noninvasive monitoring of [K+] is crucial. The morphology of the T-wave in the electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects ?[K+] and two time-warping-based T-wave morphological parameters, dw and its heart-rate corrected version dw,c, have been shown to reliably track ?[K+] from the ECG. The aim of this study is to derive polynomial models relating dw and dw,c with ?[K+], and to test their ability to reliably sense and quantify ?[K+] values. Methods: 48-hour Holter ECGs and [K+] values from six blood samples were collected from 29 ESRD-HD patients. For every patient, dw and dw,c were computed, and linear, quadratic, and cubic fitting models were derived from them. Then, Spearman's (?) and Pearson's (r) correlation coefficients, and the estimation error (ed) between ?[K+] and the corresponding model-estimated values (?^[K+]) were calculated. Results and Discussions: Nonlinear models were the most suitable for ?[K+] estimation, rendering higher Pearson's correlation (median 0.77 =r= 0.92) and smaller estimation error (median 0.20 =ed= 0.43) than the linear model (median 0.76 =r= 0.86 and 0.30 =ed= 0.40), even if similar Spearman's ? were found across models (median 0.77 =?= 0.83). Conclusion: Results support the use of nonlinear T-wave-based models as ?[K+] sensors in ESRD-HD patients.

TI - Global collaborative social network (Share4Rare) to promote citizen science in rare disease research: Platform development study
AB - Background: Rare disease communities are spread around the globe and segmented by their condition. Little research has been performed on the majority of rare diseases. Most patients who are affected by a rare disease have no research on their condition because of a lack of knowledge due to absence of common groups in the research community. // Objective: We aimed to develop a safe and secure community of rare disease patients, without geographic or language barriers, to promote research. Methods: Cocreation design methodology was applied to build Share4Rare, with consultation and input through workshops from a variety of stakeholders (patients, caregivers, clinicians, and researchers). // Results: The workshops allowed us to develop a layered version of the platform based on educating patients and caregivers with publicly accessible information, a secure community for the patients and caregivers, and a research section with the purpose of collecting patient information for analysis, which was the core and final value of the platform. // Conclusions: Rare disease research requires global collaboration in which patients and caregivers have key roles. Collective intelligence methods implemented in digital platforms reduce geographic and language boundaries and involve patients in a unique and universal project. Their contributions are essential to increase the amount of scientific knowledge that experts have on rare diseases. Share4Rare has been designed as a global platform to facilitate the donation of clinical information to foster research that matters to patients with rare conditions. The codesign methods with patients have been essential to create a patient-centric design.

TI - MMP1 drives tumor progression in large cell carcinoma of the lung through fibroblast senescence
AB - Large cell carcinoma (LCC) is a rare and aggressive lung cancer subtype with poor prognosis and no targeted therapies. Tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) derived from LCC tumors exhibit premature senescence, and coculture of pulmonary fibroblasts with LCC cell lines selectively induces fibroblast senescence, which in turn drives LCC cell growth and invasion. Here we identify MMP1 as overexpressed specifically in LCC cell lines, and we show that expression of MMP1 by LCC cells is necessary for induction of fibroblast senescence and consequent tumor promotion in both cell culture and mouse models. We also show that MMP1, in combination with TGF-ss1, is sufficient to induce fibroblast senescence and consequent LCC promotion. Furthermore, we implicate PAR-1 and oxidative stress in MMP1/TGF-ss1-induced TAF senescence. Our results establish an entirely new role for MMP1 in cancer, and support a novel therapeutic strategy in LCC based on targeting senescent TAFs.

TI - Monitoring blood potassium concentration in hemodialysis patients by quantifying T-wave morphology dynamics
AB - We investigated the ability of time-warping-based ECG-derived markers of T-wave morphology changes in time (dw) and amplitude (da), as well as their non-linear components (dNLw and dNLa), and the heart rate corrected counterpart (dw,c), to monitor potassium concentration ([K+]) changes (?[K+]) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). We compared the performance of the proposed time-warping markers, together with other previously proposed [K+] markers, such as T-wave width (Tw) and T-wave slope-to-amplitude ratio (TS/A), when computed from standard ECG leads as well as from principal component analysis (PCA)-based leads. 48-hour ECG recordings and a set of hourly-collected blood samples from 29 ESRD-HD patients were acquired. Values of dw, da, dNLw, dNLa and dw,c were calculated by comparing the morphology of the mean warped T-waves (MWTWs) derived at each hour along the HD with that from a reference MWTW, measured at the end of the HD. From the same MWTWs Tw and TS/A were also extracted. Similarly, ?[K+] was calculated as the difference between the [K+] values at each hour and the [K+] reference level at the end of the HD session. We found that dw and dw,c showed higher correlation coefficients with ?[K+] than TS/A-Spearman's (?) and Pearson's (r)-and Tw-Spearman's (?)-in both SL and PCA approaches being the intra-patient median ?=0.82 and r=0.87 in SL and ?=0.82 and r=0.89 in PCA respectively. Our findings would point at dw and dw,c as the most suitable surrogate of ?[K+], suggesting that they could be potentially useful for non-invasive monitoring of ESRD-HD patients in hospital, as well as in ambulatory settings. Therefore, the tracking of T-wave morphology variations by means of time-warping analysis could improve continuous and remote [K+] monitoring of ESRD-HD patients and flagging risk of [K+]-related cardiovascular events

TI - Balancing data on deep learning-based proteochemometric activity classification
AB - In silico analysis of biological activity data has become an essential technique in pharmaceutical development. Specifically, the so-called proteochemometric models aim to share information between targets in machine learning ligand-target activity prediction models. However, bioactivity data sets used in proteochemometric modeling are usually imbalanced, which could potentially affect the performance of the models. In this work, we explored the effect of different balancing strategies in deep learning proteochemometric target-compound activity classification models while controlling for the compound series bias through clustering. These strategies were (1) no_resampling, (2) resampling_after_clustering, (3) resampling_before_clustering, and (4) semi_resampling. These schemas were evaluated in kinases, GPCRs, nuclear receptors, and proteases from BindingDB. We observed that the predicted proportion of positives was driven by the actual data balance in the test set. Additionally, it was confirmed that data balance had an impact on the performance estimates of the proteochemometric model. We recommend a combination of data augmentation and clustering in the training set (semi_resampling) to mitigate the data imbalance effect in a realistic scenario. The code of this analysis is publicly available at https://github.com/b2slab/imbalance_pcm_benchmark.

In response, knowledge-driven approaches emerged as possible solutions to analyze large datasets by leveraging prior knowledge of biomolecular interactions represented in the form of biological networks. Nonetheless, given their size and complexity, their manual investigation quickly becomes impractical. Thus, computational approaches, such as diffusion algorithms, are often employed to interpret and contextualize the results of highthroughput experiments. Here, we present MultiPaths, a framework consisting of two independent Python packages for network analysis. While the first package, DiffuPy, comprises numerous commonly used diffusion algorithms applicable to any generic network, the second, DiffuPath, enables the application of these algorithms on multi-layer biological networks. To facilitate its usability, the framework includes a command line interface, reproducible examples and documentation. To demonstrate the framework, we conducted several diffusion experiments on three independent multi-omics datasets over disparate networks generated from pathway databases, thus, highlighting the ability of multi-layer networks to integrate multiple modalities. Finally, the results of these experiments demonstrate how the generation of harmonized networks from disparate databases can improve predictive performance with respect to individual resources.

TI - The effect of statistical normalisation on network propagation scores
AB - Network diffusion and label propagation are fundamental tools in computational biology, with applications like gene-disease association, protein function prediction and module discovery. More recently, several publications have introduced a permutation analysis after the propagation process, due to concerns that network topology can bias diffusion scores. This opens the question of the statistical properties and the presence of bias of such diffusion processes in each of its applications. In this work, we characterised some common null models behind the permutation analysis and the statistical properties of the diffusion scores. We benchmarked seven diffusion scores on three case studies: synthetic signals on a yeast interactome, simulated differential gene expression on a protein-protein interaction network and prospective gene set prediction on another interaction network. For clarity, all the datasets were based on binary labels, but we also present theoretical results for quantitative labels

TI - Effect of sequence padding on the performance of deep learning models in archaeal protein functional prediction
AB - The use of raw amino acid sequences as input for deep learning models for protein functional prediction has gained popularity in recent years. This scheme obliges to manage proteins with different lengths, while deep learning models require same-shape input. To accomplish this, zeros are usually added to each sequence up to a established common length in a process called zero-padding. However, the effect of different padding strategies on model performance and data structure is yet unknown. We propose and implement four novel types of padding the amino acid sequences. Then, we analysed the impact of different ways of padding the amino acid sequences in a hierarchical Enzyme Commission number prediction problem. Results show that padding has an effect on model performance even when there are convolutional layers implied. Contrastingly to most of deep learning works which focus mainly on architectures, this study highlights the relevance of the deemed-of-low-importance process of padding and raises awareness of the need to refine it for better performance.

TI - Marker-less monitoring protocol to analyze biomechanical joint metrics during pedaling
AB - Marker-less systems are becoming popular to detect a human skeleton in an image automatically. However, these systems have difficulties in tracking points when part of the body is hidden, or there is an artifact that does not belong to the subject (e.g., a bicycle).We present a low-cost tracking system combined with economic force-measurement sensors that allows the calculation of individual joint moments and powers affordable for anybody. The system integrates OpenPose (deep-learning based CCC library to
detect human skeletons in an image) in a system of two webcams, to record videos of a cyclist, and seven resistive sensors to measure forces at the pedals and the saddle. OpenPose identifies the skeleton candidate using a convolution neural network. A corrective algorithm was written to automatically detect the hip, knee, ankle, metatarsal and heel points from webcam-recorded motions, which overcomes the limitations of the marker-less system. Then, with the information of external forces, an inverse dynamics analysis is applied in OpenSim to calculate the joint moments and powers at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. The results show that the obtained moments have similar shapes and trends compared to the literature values. Therefore, this represents a low-cost method that could be used to estimate relevant joint kinematics and dynamics, and consequently follow up or improve cycling training plans.

TI - Detection of calcium release from individual RyR2 clusters in cardiomyocites
AB - Cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) are Ca2th release channels clustering in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. These clusters are believed to be the elementary units of Ca2th release. The distribution of these Ca2th release units plays a critical role in determining the spatio-temporal profile and stability of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2th release. RyR2 clusters located in the interior of cardiomyocytes are arranged in highly ordered arrays. However, little is known about the distribution and function of RyR2 clusters in the periphery of cardiomyocytes. Here, we used a knock-in mouse model expressing a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged RyR2 to localize RyR2 clusters in live ventricular myocytes by virtue of their GFP fluorescence. Confocal imaging and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was employed to determine and compare the distribution of GFP-RyR2 in the interior and periphery of isolated live ventricular myocytes and in intact hearts. We found tightly ordered arrays of GFP-RyR2 clusters in the interior, as previously described. In contrast, irregular distribution of GFP-RyR2 clusters was observed in the periphery. Time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence imaging revealed dynamic movements of GFP-RyR2 clusters in the periphery, which were affected by external Ca2th and RyR2 activator (caffeine) and inhibitor (tetracaine), but little detectable movement of GFP-RyR2 clusters in the interior. Furthermore, simultaneous Ca2th- and GFP-imaging demonstrated that peripheral RyR2 clusters with an irregular distribution pattern are functional with a Ca2th release profile similar to that in the interior. These results indicate that the distribution of RyR2 clusters in the periphery of live ventricular myocytes is irregular and dynamic, which is different from that of RyR2 clusters in the interior.

AB - Objective: ADHD patients show poor oculomotor control and recent studies show that attention-related eye vergence is weak in ADHD children. We aimed to assess vergence as a potential diagnostic biomarker for ADHD in adults. Method: We assessed the modulation in the angle of vergence while performing an attention task (N = 144), comparing the results for adults previously diagnosed with ADHD (N = 108) with age-matched clinical controls (N = 36). Results: Significant differences in eye vergence response modulation between clinical controls and ADHD patients were documented. Diagnostic test accuracy was 79%. Conclusion: In combination with an attention task, eye vergence responses could be used as an objective marker to support the clinical diagnosis of adult ADHD

TI - Pulsed-temperature metal oxide gas sensors for microwatt power consumption
AB - Metal Oxide (MOX) gas sensors rely on chemical reactions that occur efficiently at high temperatures, resulting in too-demanding power requirements for certain applications. Operating the sensor under a Pulsed-Temperature Operation (PTO), by which the sensor heater is switched ON and OFF periodically, is a common practice to reduce the power consumption. However, the sensor performance is degraded as the OFF periods become larger. Other research works studied, generally, PTO schemes applying waveforms to the heater with time periods of seconds and duty cycles above 20%. Here, instead, we explore the behaviour of PTO sensors working under aggressive schemes, reaching power savings of 99% and beyond with respect to continuous heater stimulation. Using sensor sensitivity and the limit of detection, we evaluated four Ultra Low Power (ULP) sensors under different PTO schemes exposed to ammonia, ethylene, and acetaldehyde. Results show that it is possible to operate the sensors with total power consumption in the range of microwatts. Despite the aggressive power reduction, sensor sensitivity suffers only a moderate decline and the limit of detection may degrade up to a factor five. This is, however, gas-dependent and should be explored on a case-by-case basis since, for example, the same degradation has not been observed for ammonia. Finally, the run-in time, i.e., the time required to get a stable response immediately after switching on the sensor, increases when reducing the power consumption, from 10 minutes to values in the range of 10-20 hours for power consumptions smaller than 200 microwatts.

TI - Mutual information between heart rate variability and respiration for emotion characterization
AB - Objective: Interest in emotion recognition has increased in recent years as a useful tool for diagnosing psycho-neural illnesses. In this study, the auto-mutual and the cross-mutual information function, AMIF and CMIF respectively, are used for human emotion recognition. Approach: The AMIF technique was applied to heart rate variability (HRV) signals to study complex interdependencies, and the CMIF technique was considered to quantify the complex coupling between HRV and respiratory signals. Both algorithms were adapted to short-term RR time series. Traditional band pass filtering was applied to the RR series at low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) bands, and a respiration-based filter bandwidth was also investigated (). Both the AMIF and the CMIF algorithms were calculated with regard to different time scales as specific complexity measures. The ability of the parameters derived from the AMIF and the CMIF to discriminate emotions was evaluated on a database of video-induced emotion elicitation. Five elicited states i.e. relax (neutral), joy (positive valence), as well as fear, sadness and anger (negative valences) were considered. Main results: The results revealed that the AMIF applied to the RR time series filtered in the band was able to discriminate between the following: relax and joy and fear, joy and each negative valence conditions, and finally fear and sadness and anger, all with a statistical significance level p?-value 0.05, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy higher than 70% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve index AUC 0.70. Furthermore, the parameters derived from the AMIF and the CMIF allowed the low signal complexity presented during fear to be characterized in front of any of the studied elicited states. Significance: Based on these results, human emotion manifested in the HRV and respiratory signal responses could be characterized by means of the information-content complexity

TI - Benchmarking network propagation methods for disease gene identification
AB - In-silico identification of potential target genes for disease is an essential aspect of drug target discovery. Recent studies suggest that successful targets can be found through by leveraging genetic, genomic and protein interaction information. Here, we systematically tested the ability of 12 varied algorithms, based on network propagation, to identify genes that have been targeted by any drug, on gene-disease data from 22 common non-cancerous diseases in OpenTargets. We considered two biological networks, six performance metrics and compared two types of input gene-disease association scores. The impact of the design factors in performance was quantified through additive explanatory models. Standard cross-validation led to over-optimistic performance estimates due to the presence of protein complexes. In order to obtain realistic estimates, we introduced two novel protein complex-aware cross-validation schemes. When seeding biological networks with known drug targets, machine learning and diffusion-based methods found around 2-4 true targets within the top 20 suggestions. Seeding the networks with genes associated to disease by genetics decreased performance below 1 true hit on average. The use of a larger network, although noisier, improved overall performance. We conclude that diffusion-based prioritisers and machine learning applied to diffusion-based features are suited for drug discovery in practice and improve over simpler neighbour-voting methods. We also demonstrate the large impact of choosing an adequate validation strategy and the definition of seed disease genes

Cognitive training, aerobic exercise and their combination have been shown to benefit health, brain, cognition and psychological status in healthy older adults. Inconsistent results across studies may be related to several variables. We need to better identify cognitive changes, individual variables that may predict the effect of these interventions, and changes in structural and functional brain outcomes as well as physiological molecular correlates that may be mediating these effects. Projecte Moviment is a multi-domain randomized trial examining the effect of these interventions applied 5 days per week for 3 months compared to a passive control group. The aim of this paper is to describe the sample, procedures and planned analyses.

TI - Refined multiscale entropy using fuzzy metrics: validation and application to nociception assessmentt
AB - The refined multiscale entropy (RMSE) approach is commonly applied to assess complexity as a function of the time scale. RMSE is normally based on the computation of sample entropy (SampEn) estimating complexity as conditional entropy. However, SampEn is dependent on the length and standard deviation of the data. Recently, fuzzy entropy (FuzEn) has been proposed, including several refinements, as an alternative to counteract these limitations. In this work, FuzEn, translated FuzEn (TFuzEn), translated-reflected FuzEn (TRFuzEn), inherent FuzEn (IFuzEn), and inherent translated FuzEn (ITFuzEn) were exploited as entropy-based measures in the computation of RMSE and their performance was compared to that of SampEn. FuzEn metrics were applied to synthetic time series of different lengths to evaluate the consistency of the different approaches. In addition, electroencephalograms of patients under sedation-analgesia procedure were analyzed based on the patient's response after the application of painful stimulation, such as nail bed compression or endoscopy tube insertion. Significant differences in FuzEn metrics were observed over simulations and real data as a function of the data length and the pain responses. Findings indicated that FuzEn, when exploited in RMSE applications, showed similar behavior to SampEn in long series, but its consistency was better than that of SampEn in short series both over simulations and real data. Conversely, its variants should be utilized with more caution, especially whether processes exhibit an important deterministic component and/or in nociception prediction at long scales

TI - Entropy measures as descriptors to identify apneas in rheoencephalographic signals
AB - Rheoencephalography (REG) is a simple and inexpensive technique that intends to monitor cerebral blood flow (CBF), but its ability to reflect CBF changes has not been extensively proved.
Based on the hypothesis that alterations in CBF during apnea should be reflected in REG signals under the form of increased complexity, several entropy metrics were assessed for REG analysis during apnea and resting periods in 16 healthy subjects: approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SampEn), fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), corrected conditional entropy (CCE) and Shannon entropy (SE). To compute these entropy metrics, a set of parameters must be defined a priori, such as, for example, the embedding dimension m, and the tolerance threshold r. A thorough analysis of the effects of parameter selection in the entropy metrics was performed, looking for the values optimizing differences between apnea and baseline signals. All entropy metrics, except SE, provided higher values for apnea periods (p-values < 0.025). FuzzyEn outperformed all other metrics, providing the lowest p-value (p = 0.0001), allowing to conclude that REG signals during apnea have higher complexity than in resting periods. Those findings suggest that REG signals reflect CBF changes provoked by apneas, even though further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis

TI - Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction infrequently evolves toward a reduced phenotype in long-term survivors: a long-term prospective longitudinal study
AB - Long-term trajectories of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in heart failure (HF) patients with preserved EF (HFpEF) remain unclear. Our objective was to assess long-term longitudinal trajectories in consecutive HFpEF patients and the prognostic impact of LVEF dynamic changes over time.Consecutive ambulatory HFpEF patients admitted to a multidisciplinary HF Unit were prospectively evaluated by 2-dimensional echocardiography at baseline and at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 years of follow-up. Exclusion criteria were patients having a previous known LVEF <50%, patients undergoing only 1 echocardiogram study, and those with a diagnosis of dilated, noncompaction, alcoholic, or toxic cardiomyopathy. One hundred twenty-six patients (age, 71+/-13 years; 63% women) were included. The main pathogeneses were valvular disease (36%) and hypertension (28%). Atrial fibrillation was present in 67 patients (53%). The mean number of echocardiographies performed was 3+/-1.2 per patient. Locally weighted error sum of squares curves showed a smooth decrease of LVEF during the 11-year follow-up that was statistically significant in linear mixed-effects modeling (P=0.01). Ischemic patients showed a higher decrease than nonischemics. The great majority (88.9%) of patients remained in the HFpEF category during follow-up; 9.5% evolved toward HF with midrange LVEF, and only 1.6% dropped to HF with reduced LVEF. No significant relationship was found between LVEF dynamics in the immediate preceding period and mortality.LVEF remained =50% in the majority of patients with HFpEF for =11 years. Only 1.6% of patients evolved to HF with reduced LVEF. Dynamic LVEF changes were not associated with mortality.

TI - The 4q25 variant rs13143308T links risk of atrial fibrillation to defective calcium homoeostasis
AB - Aims: Single nucleotide polymorphisms on chromosome 4q25 have been associated with risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) but the exiguous knowledge of the mechanistic links between these risk variants and underlying electrophysiological alterations hampers their clinical utility. Here, we tested the hypothesis that 4q25 risk variants cause alterations in the intracellular calcium homoeostasis that predispose to spontaneous electrical activity.

Methods and results: Western blotting, confocal calcium imaging, and patch-clamp techniques were used to identify mechanisms linking the 4q25 risk variants rs2200733T and rs13143308T to defects in the calcium homoeostasis in human atrial myocytes. Our findings revealed that the rs13143308T variant was more frequent in patients with AF and that myocytes from carriers of this variant had a significantly higher density of calcium sparks (14.1?+/-?4.5 vs. 3.1?+/-?1.3 events/min, P?=?0.02), frequency of transient inward currents (ITI) (1.33?+/-?0.24 vs. 0.26?+/-?0.09 events/min, P?<?0.001) and incidence of spontaneous membrane depolarizations (1.22?+/-?0.26 vs. 0.56?+/-?0.17 events/min, P?=?0.001) than myocytes from patients with the normal rs13143308G variant. These alterations were linked to higher sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium loading (10.2?+/-?1.4 vs. 7.3?+/-?0.5?amol/pF, P?=?0.01), SERCA2 expression (1.37?+/-?0.13 fold, P?=?0.03), and RyR2 phosphorylation at ser2808 (0.67?+/-?0.08 vs. 0.47?+/-?0.03, P?=?0.01) but not at ser2814 (0.28?+/-?0.14 vs. 0.31?+/-?0.14, P?=?0.61) in patients carrying the rs13143308T risk variant. Furthermore, the presence of a risk variant or AF independently increased the ITI frequency and the increase in the ITI frequency observed in carriers of the risk variants was exacerbated in those with AF. By contrast, the presence of a risk variant did not affect the amplitude or properties of the L-type calcium current in patients with or without AF.

Conclusions: Here, we identify the 4q25 variant rs13143308T as a genetic risk marker for AF, specifically associated with excessive calcium release and spontaneous electrical activity linked to increased SERCA2 expression and RyR2 phosphorylation.

The present work investigates alterations in the brain and liver metabolome of gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) following exposure at an environmentally relevant concentration (0.2 ug/L) of amitriptyline for 7 days. Analysis of variance-simultaneous component analysis (ASCA) was used to identify metabolites that distinguished exposed from control animals. Overall, alterations in lipid metabolism suggest the occurrence of oxidative stress in both brain and liver, a common adverse effect of xenobiotics. However, alterations in the amino acid arginine were also observed, likely related to the nitric oxide system, which is known to be associated with the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Additionally, changes on asparagine and methionine levels in brain and pantothenate, uric acid, formylisoglutamine/N-formimino-L-glutamate levels in liver could indicate alteration of amino acid metabolism in both tissues, and the perturbation of glutamate in liver suggests that the energy metabolism was also affected. These results revealed that environmentally relevant concentrations of amitriptyline perturbed a fraction of the metabolome which is not typically associated with antidepressant exposure in fish.

TI - Human emotion characterization by heart rate variability analysis guided by respiration
AB - Developing a tool which identifies emotions based on their effect on cardiac activity may have a potential impact on clinical practice, since it may help in the diagnosing of psycho-neural illnesses. In this study, a method based on the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) guided by respiration is proposed. The method was based on redefining the high frequency (HF) band, not only to be centered at the respiratory frequency, but also to have a bandwidth dependent on the respiratory spectrum. The method was first tested using simulated HRV signals, yielding the minimum estimation errors as compared to classical and respiratory frequency centered at HF band based definitions, independently of the values of the sympathovagal ratio. Then, the proposed method was applied to discriminate emotions in a database of video-induced elicitation. Five emotional states, relax, joy, fear, sadness and anger, were considered. The maximum correlation between HRV and respiration spectra discriminated joy vs. relax, joy vs. each negative valence emotion, and fear vs. sadness with p-value = 0.05 and AUC = 0.70. Based on these results, human emotion characterization may be improved by adding respiratory information to HRV analysis.

TI - Evaluation of cross-validation strategies in sequence-based binding prediction using deep learning
AB - Binding prediction between targets and drug-like compounds through deep neural networks has generated promising results in recent years, outperforming traditional machine learning-based methods. However, the generalization capability of these classification models is still an issue to be addressed. In this work, we explored how different cross-validation strategies applied to data from different molecular databases affect to the performance of binding prediction proteochemometrics models. These strategies are (1) random splitting, (2) splitting based on K-means clustering (both of actives and inactives), (3) splitting based on source database, and (4) splitting based both in the clustering and in the source database. These schemas are applied to a deep learning proteochemometrics model and to a simple logistic regression model to be used as baseline. Additionally, two different ways of describing molecules in the model are tested: (1) by their SMILES and (2) by three fingerprints. The classification performance of our deep learning-based proteochemometrics model is comparable to the state of the art. Our results show that the lack of generalization of these models is due to a bias in public molecular databases and that a restrictive cross-validation schema based on compound clustering leads to worse but more robust and credible results. Our results also show better performance when representing molecules by their fingerprints.

TI - Recursive model identification for the analysis of the autonomic response to exercise testing in Brugada syndrome
AB - This paper proposes the integration and analysis of a closed-loop model of the baroreflex and cardiovascular systems, focused on a time-varying estimation of the autonomic modulation of heart rate in Brugada syndrome (BS), during exercise and subsequent recovery. Patient-specific models of 44 BS patients at different levels of risk (symptomatic and asymptomatic) were identified through a recursive evolutionary algorithm. After parameter identification, a close match between experimental and simulated signals (mean error = 0.81%) was observed. The model-based estimation of vagal and sympathetic contributions were consistent with physiological knowledge, enabling to observe the expected autonomic changes induced by exercise testing. In particular, symptomatic patients presented a significantly higher parasympathetic activity during exercise, and an autonomic imbalance was observed in these patients at peak effort and during post-exercise recovery. A higher vagal modulation during exercise, as well as an increasing parasympathetic activity at peak effort and a decreasing vagal contribution during post-exercise recovery could be related with symptoms and, thus, with a worse prognosis in BS. This work proposes the first evaluation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses to exercise testing in patients suffering from BS, through the recursive identification of computational models; highlighting important trends of clinical relevance that provide new insights into the underlying autonomic mechanisms regulating the cardiovascular system in BS. The joint analysis of the extracted autonomic parameters and classic electrophysiological markers could improve BS risk stratification. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI - Multiview: a software package for multiview pattern recognition methods
AB - Multiview datasets are the norm in bioinformatics, often under the label multi-omics. Multiview
data is gathered from several experiments, measurements or feature sets available for the same subjects.
Recent studies in pattern recognition have shown the advantage of using multiview methods of clustering
and dimensionality reduction; however, none of these methods are readily available to the extent of our
knowledge. Multiview extensions of four well-known pattern recognition methods are proposed here. Three
multiview dimensionality reduction methods: multiview t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding,
multiview multidimensional scaling, and multiview minimum curvilinearity embedding, as well as a multiview
spectral clustering method. Often they produce better results than their single-view counterparts, tested
here on four multiview datasets.

TI - FELLA: an R package to enrich metabolomics data
AB - Background: Pathway enrichment techniques are useful for understanding experimental metabolomics data. Their purpose is to give context to the affected metabolites in terms of the prior knowledge contained in metabolic pathways. However, the interpretation of a prioritized pathway list is still challenging, as pathways show overlap and cross talk effects.
Results: We introduce FELLA, an R package to perform a network-based enrichment of a list of affected metabolites. FELLA builds a hierarchical representation of an organism biochemistry from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), containing pathways, modules, enzymes, reactions and metabolites. In addition to providing a list of pathways, FELLA reports intermediate entities (modules, enzymes, reactions) that link the input metabolites to them. This sheds light on pathway cross talk and potential enzymes or metabolites as targets for the condition under study. FELLA has been applied to six public datasets -three from Homo sapiens, two from Danio rerio and one from Mus musculus- and has reproduced findings from the original studies and from independent literature.
Conclusions: The R package FELLA offers an innovative enrichment concept starting from a list of metabolites, based on a knowledge graph representation of the KEGG database that focuses on interpretability. Besides reporting a list of pathways, FELLA suggests intermediate entities that are of interest per se. Its usefulness has been shown at several molecular levels on six public datasets, including human and animal models. The user can run the enrichment analysis through a simple interactive graphical interface or programmatically. FELLA is publicly available in Bioconductor under the GPL-3 license.

TI - Poincar'e plot analysis of cerebral blood flow signals : feature extraction and classification methods for apnea detection
AB - Objective: Rheoencephalography is a simple and inexpensive technique for cerebral blood flow assessment, however, it is not used in clinical practice since its correlation to clinical conditions has not yet been extensively proved. The present study investigates the ability of Poincar'e Plot descriptors from rheoencephalography signals to detect apneas in volunteers.

Methods:A group of 16 subjects participated in the study. Rheoencephalography data from baseline and apnea periods were recorded and Poincar'e Plot descriptors were extracted from the reconstructed attractors with different time lags (t). Among the set of extracted features, those presenting significant differences between baseline and apnea recordings were used as inputs to four different classifiers to optimize the apnea detection.

Results:Three features showed significant differences between apnea and baseline signals: the Poincar'e Plot ratio (SDratio), its correlation (R) and the Complex Correlation Measure (CCM). Those differences were optimized for time lags smaller than those recommended in previous works for other biomedical signals, all of them being lower than the threshold established by the position of the inflection point in the CCM curves. The classifier showing the best performance was the classification tree, with 81% accuracy and an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.927. This performance was obtained using a single input parameter, either SDratio or R.

Conclusions
Poincar'e Plot features extracted from the attractors of rheoencephalographic signals were able to track cerebral blood flow changes provoked by breath holding. Even though further validation with independent datasets is needed, those results suggest that nonlinear analysis of rheoencephalography might be a useful approach to assess the correlation of cerebral impedance with clinical changes

TI - Model-based analysis of the autonomic response to head-up tilt testing in Brugada syndrome
AB - The etiology of Brugada syndrome (BS) is complex and multifactorial, making risk stratification in this population a major challenge. Since changes in the autonomic modulation of these patients are commonly related to arrhythmic events, we analyze in this work whether the response to head-up tilt (HUT) testing on this population may provide useful, complementary information for risk stratification. In order to perform this analysis, a coupled physiological model integrating the cardiac electrical activity, the cardiovascular system and the baroreceptors reflex control of the autonomic function, in response to HUT is proposed. A sensitivity analysis was performed, based on a screening method, evidencing the influence of cardiovascular parameters on blood pressure and of baroreflex regulation on heart rate. The most sensitive parameters have been identified on a set of 20 subjects (8 controls and 12 BS patients), so as to assess subject-specific model parameters. According to the results, controls showed an increased sympathetic modulation after tilting, as well as a reduced left ventricular contractility was observed in symptomatic, with respect to asymptomatic BS patients. These results provide new insights regarding the autonomic mechanisms regulating the cardiovascular system in BS which might be used as a complementary source of information, along with classical electrophysiological parameters, for BS risk stratification.

TI - Inkjet-printed, functional heterolayers of ZnO@CuO for stoma pouch monitoring
AB - Many bowel cancer patients are in need of an artificial stoma as part of their surgical treatment, and associated post-surgical odours caused by leaking stoma pouches may lead to social isolation, which is why inconspicuous monitoring of this situation is important for affected persons. The integration of micro- and nanotechnology may offer low-cost, low-power consumption and small solutions to this challenge. To this end, we present an inkjet-printed, heterostructured gas sensor that has been built by incorporating nanosized p-type semiconducting CuO in a porous n-type ZnO matrix. The functional layer is fabricated using a combination of a colloidal suspension and sol-gel approach optimized for inkjet printing thus offering an industry-ready method for integration of nanomaterials in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) structures. Using a thermal modulation scheme we enhance the information content and classify different events. We demonstrate that a simple MEMS device using a novel hetero-nanomaterial may be used to reliably identify situations where stoma pouch content escapes.

TI - Novel characterization method of impedance cardiography signals using time-frequency distributions
AB - The purpose of this document is to describe a methodology to select the most adequate time-frequency distribution (TFD) kernel for the characterization of impedance cardiography signals (ICG). The predominant ICG beat was extracted from a patient and was synthetized using time-frequency variant Fourier approximations. These synthetized signals were used to optimize several TFD kernels according to a performance maximization. The optimized kernels were tested for noise resistance on a clinical database. The resulting optimized TFD kernels are presented with their performance calculated using newly proposed methods. The procedure explained in this work showcases a new method to select an appropriate kernel for ICG signals and compares the performance of different time-frequency kernels found in the literature for the case of ICG signals. We conclude that, for ICG signals, the performance (P) of the spectrogram with either Hanning or Hamming windows (P?=?0.780) and the extended modified beta distribution (P?=?0.765) provided similar results, higher than the rest of analyzed kernels.

TI - Dynamic trajectories of left ventricular ejection fraction in heart failure
AB - Background Long-term trajectories of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in heart failure (HF) are incompletely characterized. Objectives This study sought to examine LVEF trajectories in HF with reduced LVEF (<40%) and mid-range LVEF (40% to 49%) and the prognostic impact of LVEF dynamic changes over 15-year follow-up. Methods In this prospective, consecutive, observational registry of real-life HF outpatients, the authors performed 2-dimensional echocardiography at baseline and on a structured schedule after 1 year and then every 2 years up to 15 years. Results The mean number of LVEF measurements in the 1,160 included patients was 3.6 +/- 1.7. As a whole, Loess curves of long-term LVEF trajectories showed an inverted U shape with a marked rise in LVEF during the first year, maintained up to a decade, and a slow LVEF decline thereafter (p for trajectory <0.001). This pattern was more pronounced in HF of nonischemic origin and in women. Patients with new-onset HF (=12 months) had a higher early increase in LVEF, whereas patients with ischemic HF showed a lower LVEF increase at 1 year; both groups had a relative plateau thereafter. Patients with HF with mid-range LVEF had less of an increase (3 +/- 9%) than those with HF with reduced LVEF (9 +/- 12%) during the first year (p < 0.001), but the groups overlapped after 15 years. Patients who died had lower final LVEF and worse LVEF dynamics in the immediately preceding period than survivors. Conclusions LVEF trajectories vary in HF depending on a number of disease modifiers, but an inverted U-shaped pattern with lower LVEF at both ends of the distribution emerged. A declining LVEF in the preceding period was associated with higher mortality.

TI - Non-targeted metabolomics reveals alterations in liver and plasma of gilt-head bream exposed to oxybenzone
AB - The extensive use of the organic UV filter oxybenzone has led to its ubiquitous occurrence in the aquatic environment, causing an ecotoxicological risk to biota. Although some studies reported adverse effects, such as reproductive toxicity, further research needs to be done in order to assess its molecular effects and mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated metabolic perturbations in juvenile gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) exposed over 14 days via the water to oxybenzone (50?mg/L). The non-targeted analysis of brain, liver and plasma extracts was performed by means of UHPLC-qOrbitrap MS in positive and negative modes with both C18 and HILIC separation. Although there was no mortality or alterations in general physiological parameters during the experiment, and the metabolic profile of brain was not affected, the results of this study showed that oxybenzone could perturb both liver and plasma metabolome. The pathway enrichment suggested that different pathways in lipid metabolism (fatty acid elongation, a-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid metabolism) were significantly altered, as well as metabolites involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism. Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and energy metabolism modification. Therefore, this research indicates that oxybenzone has adverse effects beyond the commonly studied hormonal activity, and demonstrates the sensitivity of metabolomics to assess molecular-level effects of emerging contaminants.

TI - The cardiac ryanodine receptor, but not sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2-ATPase, is a major determinant of Ca2 alternans in intact mouse hearts
AB - Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ cycling is governed by the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and SR Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a). Abnormal SR Ca2+ cycling is thought to be the primary cause of Ca2+ alternans that can elicit ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. Although alterations in either RyR2 or SERCA2a function are expected to affect SR Ca2+ cycling, whether and to what extent altered RyR2 or SERCA2a function affects Ca2+ alternans is unclear. Here we employed a gain-of-function RyR2 variant (R4496C) and the phospholamban-knockout (PLB-KO) mouse model to assess the effect of genetically enhanced RyR2 or SERCA2a function on Ca2+ alternans. Confocal Ca2+ imaging revealed that RyR2-R4496C shortened SR Ca2+ release refractoriness and markedly suppressed rapid pacing-induced Ca2+ alternans. Interestingly, despite enhancing RyR2 function, intact RyR2-R4496C hearts exhibited no detectable spontaneous SR Ca2+ release events during pacing. Unlike for RyR2, enhancing SERCA2a function by ablating PLB exerted a relatively minor effect on Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts expressing RyR2 wildtype or a loss-of-function RyR2 variant, E4872Q, that promotes Ca2+ alternans. Furthermore, partial SERCA2a inhibition with 3 uM 2,5-di-tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) also had little impact on Ca2+ alternans, while strong SERCA2a inhibition with 10 uM tBHQ markedly reduced the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and suppressed Ca2+ alternans in intact hearts. Our results demonstrate that enhanced RyR2 function suppresses Ca2+ alternans in the absence of spontaneous Ca2+ release and that RyR2, but not SERCA2a, is a key determinant of Ca2+ alternans in intact working hearts, making RyR2 an important therapeutic target for cardiac alternans.

TI - A practical method to estimate the resolving power of a chemical sensor array: application to feature selection
AB - A methodology to calculate analytical figures of merit is not well established for detection
systems that are based on sensor arrays with low sensor selectivity. In this work, we
present a practical approach to estimate the Resolving Power of a sensory system,
considering non-linear sensors and heteroscedastic sensor noise. We use the definition
introduced by Shannon in the field of communication theory to quantify the number
of symbols in a noisy environment, and its version adapted by Gardner and Barlett
for chemical sensor systems. Our method combines dimensionality reduction and the
use of algorithms to compute the convex hull of the empirical data to estimate the data
volume in the sensor response space. We validate our methodology with synthetic data
and with actual data captured with temperature-modulated MOX gas sensors. Unlike
other methodologies, our method does not require the intrinsic dimensionality of the
sensor response to be smaller than the dimensionality of the input space. Moreover,
our method circumvents the problem to obtain the sensitivity matrix, which usually is
not known. Hence, our method is able to successfully compute the Resolving Power of
actual chemical sensor arrays. We provide a relevant figure of merit, and a methodology
to calculate it, that was missing in the literature to benchmark broad-response gas sensor
arrays.

TI - Multivariate classification of Brugada syndrome patients based on autonomic response to exercise testing
AB - Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher HFnu values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (AUC = 0.92 +/- 0.01; Se = 0.91 +/- 0.06; Sp = 0.90 +/- 0.05). Therefore, based on these findings, some of the analyzed HRV markers and the proposed model could be useful for risk stratification in Brugada syndrome.

TI - Applying learning analytics to students' interaction in business simulation games. The usefulness of learning analytics to know what students really learn
AB - Nowadays, different ways of communication and interaction among multiple actors are dominating learning processes. However, there are critical opinions that question the contribution of student interaction to real learning. This study applies learning analytics and data mining techniques to explore the online discussion forums of 362 business students at the bachelor and master levels, who participated in business simulation games between 2011 and 2016. The findings revealed that the most frequent contents in the students' online discussion forums were related, firstly, to the parameters and features of the business simulation game, and, secondly, to elements that fostered the students' learning process, while small talk or regular conversation did not appear to be relevant. In addition, the contents with predictive power over learning results were related to uncertainty, time, interaction, communication and collaboration, although none of these elements influenced teacher assessment of student learning. This study reveals the usefulness of learning analytics tools to gain a more wide and holistic view of the learning process of students, discovering new aspects that affect students' learning results

TI - Validity of the Polar V800 monitor for measuring heart rate variability in mountain running route conditions
AB - Purpose
This study was conducted to test, in mountain running route conditions, the accuracy of the Polar V800TM monitor as a suitable device for monitoring the heart rate variability (HRV) of runners.

Method
Eighteen healthy subjects ran a route that included a range of running slopes such as those encountered in trail and ultra-trail races. The comparative study of a V800 and a Holter SEER 12 ECG RecorderTM included the analysis of RR time series and short-term HRV analysis. A correction algorithm was designed to obtain the corrected Polar RR intervals. Six 5-min segments related to different running slopes were considered for each subject.

Results
The correlation between corrected V800 RR intervals and Holter RR intervals was very high (r?=?0.99, p?<?0.001), and the bias was less than 1 ms. The limits of agreement (LoA) obtained for SDNN and RMSSD were (-?0.25 to 0.32 ms) and (-?0.90 to 1.08 ms), respectively. The effect size (ES) obtained in the time domain HRV parameters was considered small (ES?<?0.2). Frequency domain HRV parameters did not differ (p?>?0.05) and were well correlated (r?=?0.96, p?<?0.001).

Conclusion
Narrow limits of agreement, high correlations and small effect size suggest that the Polar V800 is a valid tool for the analysis of heart rate variability in athletes while running high endurance events such as marathon, trail, and ultra-trail races.

TI - Time-frequency features for impedance cardiography signals during anesthesia using different distribution kernels
AB - Objective: This works investigates the time-frequency content of impedance cardiography signals during a propofol-remifentanil anesthesia.

Materials and Methods: In the last years, impedance cardiography (ICG) is a technique which has gained much attention. However, ICG signals need further investigation. Time-Frequency Distributions (TFDs) with 5 different kernels are used in order to analyze impedance cardiography signals (ICG) before the start of the anesthesia and after the loss of consciousness. In total, ICG signals from one hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients undergoing major surgery under general anesthesia were analyzed. Several features were extracted from the calculated TFDs in order to characterize the time-frequency content of the ICG signals. Differences between those features before and after the loss of consciousness were studied.

Results: The Extended Modified Beta Distribution (EMBD) was the kernel for which most features shows statistically significant changes between before and after the loss of consciousness. Among all analyzed features, those based on entropy showed a sensibility, specificity and area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic above 60%.

Conclusion: The anesthetic state of the patient is reflected on linear and non-linear features extracted from the TFDs of the ICG signals. Especially, the EMBD is a suitable kernel for the analysis of ICG signals and offers a great range of features which change according to the patient's anesthesia state in a statistically significant way.

TI - diffuStats: an R package to compute diffusion-based scores on biological networks
AB - Label propagation and diffusion over biological networks are a common mathematical formalism in computational biology for giving context to molecular entities and prioritising novel candidates in the area of study. 
There are several choices in conceiving the diffusion process -involving the graph kernel, the score definitions and the presence of a posterior statistical normalisation- which have an impact on the results. 
This manuscript describes diffuStats, an R package that provides a collection of graph kernels and diffusion scores, as well as a parallel permutation analysis for the normalised scores, that eases the computation of the scores and their benchmarking for an optimal choice.

TI - Dynamic and irregular distribution of RyR2 clusters in the periphery of live ventricular myocytes
AB - Cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) are Ca2+ release channels clustering in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. These clusters are believed to be the elementary units of Ca2+ release. The distribution of these Ca2+ release units plays a critical role in determining the spatio-temporal profile and stability of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. RyR2 clusters located in the interior of cardiomyocytes are arranged in highly ordered arrays. However, little is known about the distribution and function of RyR2 clusters in the periphery of cardiomyocytes. Here, we used a knock-in mouse model expressing a green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged RyR2 to localize RyR2 clusters in live ventricular myocytes by virtue of their GFP fluorescence. Confocal imaging and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was employed to determine and compare the distribution of GFP-RyR2 in the interior and periphery of isolated live ventricular myocytes and in intact hearts. We found tightly ordered arrays of GFP-RyR2 clusters in the interior, as previously described. In contrast, irregular distribution of GFP-RyR2 clusters was observed in the periphery. Time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence imaging revealed dynamic movements of GFP-RyR2 clusters in the periphery, which were affected by external Ca2+ and RyR2 activator (caffeine) and inhibitor (tetracaine), but little detectable movement of GFP-RyR2 clusters in the interior. Furthermore, simultaneous Ca2+- and GFP-imaging demonstrated that peripheral RyR2 clusters with an irregular distribution pattern are functional with a Ca2+ release profile similar to that in the interior. These results indicate that the distribution of RyR2 clusters in the periphery of live ventricular myocytes is irregular and dynamic, which is different from that of RyR2 clusters in the interior.

TI - Clinical validation of eye vergence as an objective marker for diagnosis of ADHD in children
AB - Objective: ADHD youth show poor oculomotor control. Recent research shows that attention-related eye vergence is weak in ADHD children. Method: To validate vergence as a marker to classify ADHD, we assessed the modulation in the angle of vergence of children (n = 43) previously diagnosed with ADHD while performing an attention task and compared the results with age-matched clinical controls (n = 19) and healthy peers (n = 30). Results: We observed strong vergence responses in healthy participants and weak vergence in the clinical controls. ADHD children showed no significant vergence responses. Machine-learning models classified ADHD patients (n = 21) from healthy controls (n = 21) with an accuracy of 96.3% (false positive [FP]: 5.12%; false negative [FN]: 0%; area under the curve [AUC]: 0.99) and ADHD children (n = 11) from clinical controls (n = 14) with an accuracy of 85.7% (FP: 4.5%; FN: 19.2%, AUC: 0.90). Conclusion: In combination with an attention task, vergence responses can be used as an objective marker to detect ADHD in children.

TI - Multiview and multifeature spectral clustering using common eigenvectors
AB - An ever-increasing number of data analysis problems include more than one view of the data, i.e. differ-
ent measurement approaches to the population under study. In consequence, pattern analysis methods
that deal appropriately with multiview data are becoming increasingly useful. In this paper, a novel mul-
tiview spectral clustering algorithm is presented (multiview spectral clustering by common eigenvectors,
or MVSC-CEV), based on computing the common eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices derived from
the similarity matrices of the input data. This algorithm maintains the features of spectral clustering,
while allowing the use of an arbitrary number of input views, possibly of a different nature (feature or
graph space) and with different dimensions. The method has been tested on four standard multiview
data sets (UCI's Handwritten, BBC segmented news, Max Planck Institute's Animal With Attributes and
Reuters multilingual), and compared with seven methods in the state of the art. Seven standard clus-
tering evaluation metrics have been used in the experiments. The quality of the clustering produced by
MVSC-CEV is above those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods in the majority of evaluation met-
rics and dataset combinations. The computation times of this method are approximately twice those of
the baseline spectral clustering of the concatenated data views.

TI - Chemical sensor systems and associated algorithms for fire detection: A review
AB - Indoor  fire  detection  using  gas  chemical  sensing  has  been  a  subject  of  investigation  since  the  early  nineties.  This  approach  leverages  the  fact  that,  for  certain  types  of  fire,  chemical  volatiles  appear  before  smoke  particles  do.  Hence,  systems  based  on  chemical  sensing  can  provide  faster  fire  alarm  responses  than  conventional  smoke-based  fire  detectors.  Moreover,  since  it  is  known  that  most  casualties in fires are produced from toxic emissions rather than actual burns, gas-based  fire  detection  could  provide  an  additional  level  of  safety  to  building occupants. In this line, since the 2000s, electrochemical cells for carbon monoxide sensing   have   been   incorporated   into   fire   detectors.   Even   systems   relying   exclusively  on  gas  sensors  have  been  explored  as  fire  detectors.  However,  gas  sensors respond to a large variety of volatiles beyond combustion products. As a result,   chemical-based   fire   detectors   require   multivariate   data   processing   techniques  to  ensure  high  sensitivity  to  fires  and  false  alarm  immunity.  In  this  paper, we the survey toxic emissions produced in fires and defined standards for fire detection systems. We also review the state of the art of chemical sensor systems for fire detection and the associated signal and data processing algorithms. We also examine  the  experimental  protocols  used  for  the  validation  of  the  different  approaches, as the complexity of the test measurements also impacts on reported sensitivity and specificity measures. All in all, further research and extensive test under different fire and nuisance scenarios are still required before gas-based fire detectors  penetrate  largely  into  the  market.  Nevertheless,  the  use  of  dynamic  features and multivariate models that exploit sensor correlations seems imperative.

TI - Sex differences in autonomic response to exercise testing in patients with Brugada syndrome
AB - Ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest and especially during sleep, suggesting that changes in the autonomic modulation may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis. The autonomic response to exercise and subsequent recovery was evaluated on 105 patients diagnosed with BS (twenty-four were symptomatic), by means of a time-frequency heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, so as to propose a novel predictive model capable of distinguishing symptomatic and asymptomatic BS populations. During incremental exercise, symptomatic patients showed higher HFnu values, probably related to an increased parasympathetic modulation, with respect to asymptomatic subjects. In addition, those extracted HRV features best distinguishing between populations were selected using a two-step feature selection approach, so as to build a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The final features subset included one third of the total amount of extracted autonomic markers, mostly acquired during incremental exercise and active recovery, thus evidencing the relevance of these test segments in BS patients classification. The derived predictive model showed an improved performance with respect to previous works in the field (AUC = 0.92 +/- 0.01; Se = 0.91 +/- 0.06; Sp = 0.90 +/- 0.05). Therefore, based on these findings, some of the analyzed HRV markers and the proposed model could be useful for risk stratification in Brugada syndrome.

TI - Null diffusion-based enrichment for metabolomics data
AB - Metabolomics experiments identify metabolites whose abundance varies as the conditions under study change. Pathway enrichment tools help in the identification of key metabolic processes and in building a plausible biological explanation for these variations. Although several methods are available for pathway enrichment using experimental evidence, metabolomics does not yet have a comprehensive overview in a network layout at multiple molecular levels. We propose a novel pathway enrichment procedure for analysing summary metabolomics data based on sub-network analysis in a graph representation of a reference database. Relevant entries are extracted from the database according to statistical measures over a null diffusive process that accounts for network topology and pathway crosstalk. Entries are reported as a sub-pathway network, including not only pathways, but also modules, enzymes, reactions and possibly other compound candidates for further analyses. This provides a richer biological context, suitable for generating new study hypotheses and potential enzymatic targets. Using this method, we report results from cells depleted for an uncharacterised mitochondrial gene using GC and LC-MS data and employing KEGG as a knowledge base. Partial validation is provided with NMR-based tracking of 13C glucose labelling of these cells.

TI - Assessment of heart rate variability during an endurance mountain trail race by multi-scale entropy analysis
AB - (c) 2017 by the authors. The aim of the study was to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) response to high-intensity exercise during a 35-km mountain trail race and to ascertain whether fitness level could influence autonomic nervous system (ANS) modulation. Time-domain, frequency-domain, and multi-scale entropy (MSE) indexes were calculated for eleven mountain-trail runners who completed the race. Many changes were observed, mostly related to exercise load and fatigue. These changes were characterized by increased mean values and standard deviations of the normal-to-normal intervals associated with sympathetic activity, and by decreased differences between successive intervals related to parasympathetic activity. Normalized low frequency (LF) power suggested that ANS modulation varied greatly during the race and between individuals. Normalized high frequency (HF) power, associated with parasympathetic activity, varied considerably over the race, and tended to decrease at the final stages, whereas changes in the LF/HF ratio corresponded to intervals with varying exercise load. MSE indexes, related to system complexity, indicated the existence of many interactions between the heart and its neurological control mechanism. The time-domain, frequency-domain, and MSE indexes were also able to discriminate faster from slower runners, mainly in the more difficult and in the final stages of the race. These findings suggest the use of HRV analysis to study cardiac function mechanisms in endurance sports.

TI - Affected pathways and transcriptional regulators in gene expression response to an ultra-marathon trail: Global and independent activity approaches
AB - Gene expression (GE) analyses on blood samples from marathon and half-marathon runners have reported significant impacts on the immune and inflammatory systems. An ultra-marathon trail (UMT) represents a greater effort due to its more testing conditions. For the first time, we report the genome-wide GE profiling in a group of 16 runners participating in an 82 km UMT competition. We quantified their differential GE profile before and after the race using HuGene2.0st microarrays (Affymetrix Inc., California, US). The results obtained were decomposed by means of an independent component analysis (ICA) targeting independent expression modes. We observed significant differences in the expression levels of 5,084 protein coding genes resulting in an overrepresentation of 14% of the human biological pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. These were mainly clustered on terms related with protein synthesis repression, altered immune system and infectious diseases related mechanisms. In a second analysis, 27 out of the 196 transcriptional regulators (TRs) included in the Open Regulatory Annotation database were overrepresented. Among these TRs, we identified transcription factors from the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) family EPAS1 (p< 0.01) and HIF1A (p<0.001), and others jointly described in the gluconeogenesis program such as HNF4 (p< 0.001), EGR1 (p<0.001), CEBPA (p< 0.001) and a highly specific TR, YY1 (p<0.01). The five independent components, obtained from ICA, further revealed a down-regulation of 10 genes distributed in the complex I, III and V from the electron transport chain. This mitochondrial activity reduction is compatible with HIF-1 system activation. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, known to be regulated by HIF, also emerged (p<0.05). Additionally, and related to the brain rewarding circuit, the endocannabinoid signalling pathway was overrepresented (p<0.05).

TI - Automatic Brugada pattern detection on continuous electrocardiographic monitoring
AB - Background: As described in the literature, Brugada syndrome (BrS) patients presenting a spontaneous type 1 electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern are related to a greater arrhythmic risk compared to those with a flecainideinduced type 1 ECG pattern. The 24hour continuous ECG provides relevant cardiac information. However, it is usually challenging and time consuming to analyze.

Purpose: This work presents an automatic algorithm able to detect significant ECG parameters in the disease, such as Brugada-like pattern burden on ECG monitoring.

Methods: The algorithm integrates a previously developed and validated ECG delineator in order to locate the beginning, peak and ending of cardiac waves. Then, it classifies each beat between normal or Brugada-like, based on the morphology of the detected waves (see table below). Likewise, the algorithm includes the detection of other relevant ECG features: STsegment elevation, PR, QRS and QTc intervals duration, heart rate variability and number of premature ventricular contractions, among others. Validation of the Brugada-pattern detector was done by assessment of the beat-to-beat correlation of the 24hour 12lead ECG signals in 2 BrS patients with spontaneous type 1 ECG and 1 healthy individual, 2 blinded arrhythmia specialists.

Results: From a random sample of 212 beats, type 1 ECG pattern was correctly detected in the 98.11% of beats in V1, 84.91% in V2, 92.45% in aVR and 100% in aVF. Erroneous detections mainly resulted from incorrect Twave delineations in noisy segments. Regarding type 2 ECG detections, all analyzed beats in V1 and the 92.45% in V2 were properly classified. 

Conclusion: This study shows the feasibility of the algorithm to automatically detect Brugada-like beats on a 24hour continuous ECG monitoring. Future work will be focused on testing the performed detector in an extensive sample of patients diagnosed with BrS that, based on their cardiac events, will allow to determine the association of this ECG parameter burden with the individual risk of suffering sudden cardiac death.

TI - Assessment of respiratory flow cycle morphology in patients with chronic heart failure
AB - Breathing pattern as periodic breathing (PB) in chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality risk. This work investigates the significance of a number of time domain parameters for characterizing respiratory flow cycle morphology in patients with CHF. Thus, our primary goal is to detect PB pattern and identify patients at higher risk. In addition, differences in respiratory flow cycle morphology between CHF patients (with and without PB) and healthy subjects are studied. Differences between these parameters are assessed by investigating the following three classification issues: CHF patients with PB versus with non-periodic breathing (nPB), CHF patients (both PB and nPB) versus healthy subjects, and nPB patients versus healthy subjects. Twenty-six CHF patients (8/18 with PB/nPB) and 35 healthy subjects are studied. The results show that the maximal expiratory flow interval is shorter and with lower dispersion in CHF patients than in healthy subjects. The flow slopes are much steeper in CHF patients, especially for PB. Both inspiration and expiration durations are reduced in CHF patients, mostly for PB. Using the classification and regression tree technique, the most discriminant parameters are selected. For signals shorter than 1 min, the time domain parameters produce better results than the spectral parameters, with accuracies for each classification of 82/78, 89/85, and 91/89 %, respectively. It is concluded that morphologic analysis in the time domain is useful, especially when short signals are analyzed.

TI - Heart rate complexity analysis in Brugada syndrome during physical stress testing
AB - Symptoms such as ventricular arrhythmias in Brugada syndrome (BS) typically occur at rest, especially during sleep, suggesting that the autonomic nervous system (ANS) function may be relevant in the arrhythmogenesis of the disease. The aim of this work was to assess the ANS response captured by a non-linear heart rate variability (HRV) measure in 69 patients diagnosed with BS, who underwent a standardized physical stress test. Heart rate complexity (HRC) was evaluated by the power-law scaling analysis (Beta slope) during rest, exercise, recovery and rest post-recovery, in order to discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic BS patients. Symptomatic patients showed a significant reduction in HRC in comparison to asymptomatic subjects, after exertion (p=0.015); during the whole recovery period (p=0.023), and, in particular within the passive recovery phase (p=0.025), as well as during rest post-recovery (p=0.022). Based on these results, symptoms could be associated with a lower ANS complexity during the stress test stages where parasympathetic activity is predominant. Therefore, the proposed HRV indicators could be of help in the risk stratification of asymptomatic patients.

TI - Early prediction of Alzheimer's disease using null longitudinal model-based classifiers
AB - Incipient Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by a slow onset of clinical symptoms, with pathological brain changes starting several years earlier. Consequently, it is necessary to first understand and differentiate age-related changes in brain regions in the absence of disease, and then to support early and accurate AD diagnosis. However, there is poor understanding of the initial stage of AD; seemingly healthy elderly brains lose matter in regions related to AD, but similar changes can also be found in non-demented subjects having mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By using a Linear Mixed Effects approach, we modelled the change of 166 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers available at a 5-year follow up on healthy elderly control (HC, n = 46) subjects. We hypothesized that, by identifying their significant variant (vr) and quasi-variant (qvr) brain regions over time, it would be possible to obtain an age-based null model, which would characterize their normal atrophy and growth patterns as well as the correlation between these two regions. By using the null model on those subjects who had been clinically diagnosed as HC (n = 161), MCI (n = 209) and AD (n = 331), normal age-related changes were estimated and deviation scores (residuals) from the observed MRI-based biomarkers were computed. Subject classification, as well as the early prediction of conversion to MCI and AD, were addressed through residual-based Support Vector Machines (SVM) modelling. We found reductions in most cortical volumes and thicknesses (with evident gender differences) as well as in sub-cortical regions, including greater atrophy in the hippocampus. The average accuracies (ACC) recorded for men and women were: AD-HC: 94.11%, MCI-HC: 83.77% and MCI converted to AD (cAD)-MCI non-converter (sMCI): 76.72%. Likewise, as compared to standard clinical diagnosis methods, SVM classifiers predicted the conversion of cAD to be 1.9 years earlier for females (ACC:72.5%) and 1.4 years earlier for males (ACC:69.0%).

TI - The Central role of KNG1 gene as a genetic determinant of coagulation pathway-related traits: Exploring metaphenotypes
AB - Traditional  genetic studies of single traits may be unable to detect the  pleiotropic  effects  involved  in complex  diseases.  To detect the correlation  that  exists between  several  phenotypes  involved in the same biological process, we introduce an original methodology to analyze sets of correlated phenotypes involved in the coagulation cascade in genome-wide association studies. The  methodology  consists  of  a  two-stage  process. First, we define  new  phenotypic  meta-variables (linear  combinations  of  the  original  phenotypes),  named metaphenotypes, by applying Independent Component  Analysis for the multivariate analysis of correlated phenotypes   (i.e.   the levels of coagulation pathway-related proteins). The resulting 
metaphenotypes integrate   the   information regarding the underlying   biological process (i.e. thrombus/clot formation). Secondly, we take advantage of a family based Genome Wide Association Study to identify genetic elements influencing these metaphenotypes and consequently thrombosis risk. Our study utilized data from the GAIT Project (Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia). We obtained 15 metaphenotypes,  which  showed  significant  heritabilities,  ranging  from  0.2  to  0.7. These  results  indicate  the  importance  of  genetic  factors  in  the  variability  of  these  traits.  We  found 4 metaphenotypes that showed significant associations with SNPs. The most relevant were those mapped in a region near the HRG, FETUB and KNG1 genes. Our results are provocative since they show that the KNG1 locus  plays a central role as a genetic determinant  of  the  entire  coagulation pathway and thrombus/clot formation. Integrating data from multiple    correlated    measurements through metaphenotypes is  a  promising  approach  to  elucidate the hidden genetic mechanisms underlying complex diseases.

TI - Avoiding hard chromatographic segmentation: A moving window approach for the automated resolution of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics signals by multivariate methods
AB - Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) produces large and complex datasets characterized by co-eluted compounds and at trace levels, and with a distinct compound ion-redundancy as a result of the high fragmentation by the electron impact ionization. Compounds in GC-MS can be resolved by taking advantage of the multivariate nature of GC-MS data by applying multivariate resolution methods. However, multivariate methods have to be applied in small regions of the chromatogram, and therefore chromatograms are segmented prior to the application of the algorithms. The automation of this segmentation process is a challenging task as it implies separating between informative data and noise from the chromatogram. This study demonstrates the capabilities of independent component analysis-orthogonal signal deconvolution (ICA-OSD) and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) with an overlapping moving window implementation to avoid the typical hard chromatographic segmentation. Also, after being resolved, compounds are aligned across samples by an automated alignment algorithm. We evaluated the proposed methods through a quantitative analysis of GC-qTOF MS data from 25 serum samples. The quantitative performance of both moving window ICA-OSD and MCR-ALS-based implementations was compared with the quantification of 33 compounds by the XCMS package. Results shown that most of the R2 coefficients of determination exhibited a high correlation (R2 > 0.90) in both ICA-OSD and MCR-ALS moving window-based approaches.

TI - Cardiac electrical defects in progeroid mice and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome patients with nuclear lamina alterations
AB - Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disease caused by defective prelamin A processing, leading to nuclear lamina alterations, severe cardiovascular pathology, and premature death. Prelamin A alterations also occur in physiological aging. It remains unknown how defective prelamin A processing affects the cardiac rhythm. We show age-dependent cardiac repolarization abnormalities in HGPS patients that are also present in the Zmpste24-/- mouse model of HGPS. Challenge of Zmpste24-/- mice with the ss-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol did not trigger ventricular arrhythmia but caused bradycardia-related premature ventricular complexes and slow-rate polymorphic ventricular rhythms during recovery. Patch-clamping in Zmpste24-/- cardiomyocytes revealed prolonged calcium-transient duration and reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium loading and release, consistent with the absence of isoproterenol-induced ventricular arrhythmia. Zmpste24-/- progeroid mice also developed severe fibrosis-unrelated bradycardia and PQ interval and QRS complex prolongation. These conduction defects were accompanied by overt mislocalization of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43). Remarkably, Cx43 mislocalization was also evident in autopsied left ventricle tissue from HGPS patients, suggesting intercellular connectivity alterations at late stages of the disease. The similarities between HGPS patients and progeroid mice reported here strongly suggest that defective cardiac repolarization and cardiomyocyte connectivity are important abnormalities in the HGPS pathogenesis that increase the risk of arrhythmia and premature death.

TI - Suppression of ryanodine receptor function prolongs Ca2+ release refractoriness and promotes cardiac alternans in intact hearts
AB - Beat-to-beat alternations in the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca2+ transient (Ca2+ alternans) are thought to be the primary cause of cardiac alternans that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. Despite its important role in arrhythmogenesis, the mechanism underlying Ca2+ alternans remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the major Ca2+ release channel responsible for cytosolic Ca2+ transients, in cardiac alternans. Using a unique mouse model harboring a suppression-of-function (SOF) RyR2 mutation (E4872Q), we assessed the effect of genetically suppressing RyR2 function on Ca2+ and action potential duration (APD) alternans in intact hearts, and electrocardiogram (ECG) alternans in vivo. We found that RyR2-SOF hearts displayed prolonged sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release refractoriness and enhanced propensity for Ca2+ alternans. RyR2-SOF hearts/mice also exhibited increased propensity for APD and ECG alternans. Caffeine, which enhances RyR2 activity and the propensity for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), suppressed Ca2+ alternans in RyR2-SOF hearts, whereas carvedilol, a ss-blocker that suppresses RyR2 activity and CPVT, promoted Ca2+ alternans in these hearts. Thus, RyR2 function is an important determinant of Ca2+, APD, and ECG alternans. Our data also indicate that the activity of RyR2 influences the propensity for cardiac alternans and CPVT in an opposite manner. Therefore, overly suppressing or enhancing RyR2 function is pro-arrhythmic.

TI - Comparison of the qCON and qNOX indices for the assessment of unconsciousness level and noxious stimulation response during surgery
AB - The objective of this work is to compare the performances of two electroencephalogram based indices for detecting loss of consciousness and loss of response to nociceptive stimulation. Specifically, their behaviour after drug induction and during recovery of consciousness was pointed out. Data was recorded from 140 patients scheduled for general anaesthesia with a combination of propofol and remifentanil. The qCON 2000 monitor (Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain) was used to calculate the qCON and qNOX. Loss of response to verbal command and loss of eye-lash reflex were assessed during the transition from awake to anesthetized, defining the state of loss of consciousness. Movement as a response to laryngeal mask (LMA) insertion was interpreted as the response to the nociceptive stimuli. The patients were classified as movers or non-movers. The values of qCON and qNOX were statistically compared. Their fall times and rise times defined at the start and at the end of the surgery were calculated and compared. The results showed that the qCON was able to predict loss of consciousness such as loss of verbal command and eyelash reflex better than qNOX, while the qNOX has a better predictive value for response to noxious stimulation such as LMA insertion. From the analysis of the fall and rise times, it was found that the qNOX fall time (median: 217 s) was significantly longer (p value <0.05) than the qCON fall time (median: 150 s). At the end of the surgery, the qNOX started to increase in median at 45 s before the first annotation related to response to stimuli or recovery of consciousness, while the qCON at 88 s after the first annotation related to response to stimuli or recovery of consciousness (p value <0.05). The indices qCON and qNOX showed different performances in the detection of loss of consciousness and loss of response to stimuli during induction and recovery of consciousness. Furthermore, the qCON showed faster decrease during induction. This behaviour is associated with the hypothesis that the loss of response to stimuli (analgesic effect) might be reached after the loss of consciousness (hypnotic effect). On the contrary, the qNOX showed a faster increase at the end of the surgery, associated with the hypothesis that a higher probability of response to stimuli might be reached before the recovery of consciousness.

TI - eRah: A Computational Tool Integrating Spectral Deconvolution and Alignment with Quantification and Identification of Metabolites in GC/MS-Based Metabolomics
AB - Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been a long-standing approach used for identifying small molecules due to the highly reproducible ionization process of electron impact ionization (EI). However, the use of GC-EI MS in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex data sets characterized by coeluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information on metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce eRah, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of GC/MS chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance (CMLC) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (iv) missing compound recovery, and (v) identification of metabolites by spectral library matching using publicly available mass spectra. eRah outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of compounds for each sample. The automated capabilities of eRah are demonstrated by the analysis of GC-time-of-flight (TOF) MS data from plasma samples of adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and healthy controls. The quantitative results of eRah are compared to centWave, the peak-picking algorithm implemented in the widely used XCMS package, MetAlign, and ChromaTOF software. Significantly dysregulated metabolites are further validated using pure standards and targeted analysis by GC-triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS, LC-QqQ, and NMR. eRah is freely available at http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=erah.

TI - Performance evaluation of secondary control policies with respect to digital communications properties in inverter-based islanded microgrids
AB - A key challenge for inverted-based microgrids working in islanded mode is to maintain their own frequency and voltage to a certain reference values while regulating the active and reactive power among distributed generators and loads. The implementation of frequency and voltage restoration control policies often requires the use of a digital communication network for real-time data exchange (tertiary control covers the coordi- nated operation of the microgrid and the host grid). Whenever a digital network is placed within the loop, the operation of the secondary control may be affected by the inherent properties of the communication technology. This paper analyses the effect that properties like transmission intervals and message dropouts have for four existing representative approaches to secondary control in a scalable islanded microgrid. The simulated results reveals pros and cons for each approach, and identifies threats that properly avoided or handled in advance can prevent failures that otherwise would occur. Selected experimental results on a low- scale laboratory microgrid corroborate the conclusions extracted from the simulation study.

TI - DNA methylation profiling unveils TGF-ss hyperresponse in tumor associated fibroblasts from lung cancer patients
AB - There is growing interest in defining the aberrant molecular differences between normal and tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) that support tumor progression. For this purpose, we recently conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of TAFs and paired control fibroblasts (CFs) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and reported a widespread hypomethylation concomitantly with focal gain of DNA methylation; in addition, we found evidence that a fraction of lung TAFs are fibrocytes in origin. Of note, the aberrant epigenome of lung TAFs had a global impact in gene expression and a selective impact on the TGF-ss pathway. To get insights on the functional implications of the latter impact, we analyzed the response of lung TAFs to exogenous TGF-ss1 in terms of activation and contractility. We found a larger expression of a panel of activation markers including a-SMA and collagen-I in TAFs compared to control fibroblasts. Likewise, TGF-ss1 elicited a larger contractility in TAFs than in CFs as assessed by traction force microscopy. These findings reveal that lung TAFs are hyperresponsive to TGF-ss1, which may underlie the expansion and/or maintenance of the tumor-promoting desmoplastic stroma in lung cancer.

TI - Online decorrelation of humidity and temperature in chemical sensors for continuous monitoring
AB - A method for online decorrelation of chemical sensor signals from the effects of environmental humidity and temperature variations is proposed. The goal is to improve the accuracy of electronic nose measurements for continuous monitoring by processing data from simultaneous readings of environmental humidity and temperature. The electronic nose setup built for this study included eight metal-oxide sensors, temperature and humidity sensors with a wireless communication link to external computer. This wireless electronic nose was used to monitor the air for two years in the residence of one of the authors and it collected data continuously during 537 days with a sampling rate of 1 sample per second. To estimate the effects of variations in air humidity and temperature on the chemical sensors' signals, we used a standard energy band model for an n-type metal-oxide (MOX) gas sensor. The main assumption of the model is that variations in sensor conductivity can be expressed as a nonlinear function of changes in the semiconductor energy bands in the presence of external humidity and temperature variations. Fitting this model to the collected data, we confirmed that the most statistically significant factors are humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity. This simple model achieves excellent accuracy with a coefficient of determination R2 close to 1. To show how the humidity-temperature correction model works for gas discrimination, we constructed a model for online discrimination among banana, wine and baseline response. This shows that pattern recognition algorithms improve performance and reliability by including the filtered signal of the chemical sensors.

However, algorithms for GCx GC-MS data processing are needed in order to automatically process the data and extract the purest information about the compounds appearing in complex biological samples. This study shows the capability of independent component analysis-orthogonal signal deconvolution (ICA-OSD), an algorithm based on blind source separation and distributed in an R package called osd, to extract the spectra of the compounds appearing in GCx GC-MS chromatograms in an automated manner. We studied the performance of ICA-OSD by the quantification of 38 metabolites through a set of 20 Jurkat cell samples analyzed by GCx GC-MS. The quantification by ICA-OSD was compared with a supervised quantification by selective ions, and most of the R2 coefficients of determination were in good agreement (R-2>0.90) while up to 24 cases exhibited an excellent linear relation (R-2>0.95). We concluded that ICA-OSD can be used to resolve co-eluted compounds in GC x GC-MS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI - Electrophysiological effects of selective atrial coronary artery occlusion in humans
AB - Background-The arrhythmogenesis of ventricular myocardial ischemia has been extensively studied, but models of atrial ischemia in humans are lacking. This study aimed at describing the electrophysiological alterations induced by acute atrial ischemia secondary to atrial coronary branch occlusion during elective coronary angioplasty.; Methods and Results-Clinical data, 12-lead ECG, 12-hour Holter recordings, coronary angiography, and serial plasma levels of high-sensitivity troponin T and midregional proatrial natriuretic peptide were prospectively analyzed in 109 patients undergoing elective angioplasty of right or circumflex coronary arteries. Atrial coronary branches were identified and after the procedure patients were allocated into two groups: atrial branch occlusion (ABO, n= 17) and atrial branch patency (non-ABO, n= 92). In comparison with the non-ABO, patients with ABO showed: (1) higher incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction (20% versus 53%, P= 0.01); (2) more frequent intra-atrial conduction delay (19% versus 46%, P= 0.03); (3) more marked PR segment deviation in the Holter recordings; and (4) higher incidence of atrial tachycardia (15% versus 41%, P= 0.02) and atrial fibrillation (0% versus 12%, P= 0.03). After adjustment by a propensity score, ABO was an independent predictor of periprocedural infarction (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-11.6, P< 0.05) and atrial arrhythmias (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-20.5, P= 0.02).; Conclusions-Selective atrial coronary artery occlusion during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is associated with myocardial ischemic damage, atrial arrhythmias, and intra-atrial conduction delay. Our data suggest that atrial ischemic episodes might be considered as a potential cause of atrial fibrillation in patients with chronic coronary artery disease.

TI - Applicability of semi-supervised learning assumptions for gene ontology terms prediction
AB - Gene Ontology (GO) is one of the most important resources in bioinformatics, aiming to provide a unified framework for the biological annotation of genes and proteins across all species. Predicting GO terms is an essential task for bioinformatics, but the number of available labelled proteins is in several cases insufficient for training reliable machine learning classifiers. Semi-supervised learning methods arise as a powerful solution that explodes the information contained in unlabelled data in order to improve the estimations of traditional supervised approaches. However, semi-supervised learning methods have to make strong assumptions about the nature of the training data and thus, the performance of the predictor is highly dependent on these assumptions. This paper presents an analysis of the applicability of semi-supervised learning assumptions over the specific task of GO terms prediction, focused on providing judgment elements that allow choosing the most suitable tools for specific GO terms. The results show that semi-supervised approaches significantly outperform the traditional supervised methods and that the highest performances are reached when applying the cluster assumption. Besides, it is experimentally demonstrated that cluster and manifold assumptions are complimentary to each other and an analysis of which GO terms can be more prone to be correctly predicted with each assumption, is provided.

TI - Calibration transfer and drift counteraction in chemical sensor arrays using direct standardization
AB - Inherent variability of chemical sensors makes it necessary to calibrate chemical detection systems individually. This shortcoming has traditionally limited usability of systems based on metal oxide gas sensor arrays and prevented mass-production for some applications. Here, aiming at exploring calibration transfer between chemical sensor arrays, we exposed five twin 8-sensor detection units to different concentration levels of ethanol, ethylene, carbon monoxide, or methane. First, we built calibration models using data acquired with a master unit. Second, to explore the transferability of the calibration models, we used Direct Standardization to map the signals of a slave unit to the space of the master unit in calibration. In particular, we evaluated the transferability of the calibration models to other detection units, and within the same unit measuring days apart. Our results show that signals acquired with one unit can be successfully mapped to the space of a reference unit. Hence, calibration models trained with a master unit can be extended to slave units using a reduced number of transfer samples, diminishing thereby calibration costs. Similarly, signals of a sensing unit can be transformed to match sensor behavior in the past to mitigate drift effects. Therefore, the proposed methodology can reduce calibration costs in mass-production and delay recalibrations due to sensor aging. Acquired dataset is made publicly available

TI - Assessment of nociceptive responsiveness levels during sedation-analgesia by entropy analysis of EEG
AB - The level of sedation in patients undergoing medical procedures is decided to assure unconsciousness and prevent pain. The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work was to analyze the capability of prediction of nociceptive responses based on refined multiscale entropy (RMSE) and auto mutual information function (AMIF) applied to EEG signals recorded in 378 patients scheduled to undergo ultrasonographic endoscopy under sedation-analgesia. Two observed categorical responses after the application of painful stimulation were analyzed: the evaluation of the Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) after nail bed compression and the presence of gag reflex (GAG) during endoscopy tube insertion. In addition, bispectrum (BIS), heart rate (HR), predicted concentrations of propofol (CeProp) and remifentanil (CeRemi) were annotated with a resolution of 1 s. Results showed that functions based on RMSE, AMIF, HR and CeRemi permitted predicting different stimulation responses during sedation better than BIS.

TI - Solarius: an R interface to SOLAR for variance component analysis in pedigrees
AB - The open source environment R is one of the most widely used software for statistical computing. It provides a variety of applications including statistical genetics. Most of the powerful tools for quantitative genetic analyses are stand-alone free programs developed by researchers in academia. SOLAR is one of the standard software programs to perform linkage and association mappings of the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in pedigrees of arbitrary size and complexity. solarius allows the user to exploit the variance component methods implemented in SOLAR. It automates such routine operations as formatting pedigree and phenotype data. It parses also the model output and contains summary and plotting functions for exploration of the results. In addition, solarius enables parallel computing of the linkage and association analyses that makes the calculation of genome-wide scans more efficient.

TI - Clinical phenotype clustering in cardiovascular risk patients for the identification of responsive metabotypes after red wine polyphenol intake
AB - (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. This study aims to evaluate the robustness of clinical and metabolic phenotyping through, for the first time, the identification of differential responsiveness to dietary strategies in the improvement of cardiometabolic risk conditions. Clinical phenotyping of 57 volunteers with cardiovascular risk factors was achieved using k-means cluster analysis based on 69 biochemical and anthropometric parameters. Cluster validation based on Dunn and Figure of Merit analysis for internal coherence and external homogeneity were employed. k-Means produced four clusters with particular clinical profiles. Differences on urine metabolomic profiles among clinical phenotypes were explored and validated by multivariate orthogonal signal correction partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OSC-PLS-DA) models. OSC-PLS-DA of 1H-NMR data revealed that model comparing "obese and diabetic cluster" (OD-c) against "healthier cluster" (H-c) showed the best predictability and robustness in terms of explaining the pairwise differences between clusters. Considering these two clusters, distinct groups of metabolites were observed following an intervention with wine polyphenol intake (WPI; 733 equivalents of gallic acid/day) per 28 days. Glucose was significantly linked to OD-metabotype (P&lt;.01), and lactate, betaine and dimethylamine showed a significant trend. Tartrate (P&lt;.001) was associated with wine polyphenol intervention (OD-c_WPI and H-c_WPI), whereas mannitol, threonine methanol, fucose and 3-hydroxyphenylacetate showed a significant trend. Interestingly, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate significantly increased in H-c_WPI compared to OD-c_WPI and to basal groups (P&lt;.05)-gut microbial-derived metabolite after polyphenol intake-thereby exhibiting a clear metabotypic intervention effect. Results revealed gut microbiota responsive phenotypes to wine polyphenols intervention. Overall, this study illustrates a novel metabolomic strategy for characterizing interindividual responsiveness to dietary intervention and identification of health benefits.

TI - Prevention of adenosine A2A receptor activation diminishes beat-to-beat alternation in human atrial myocytes
AB - (c) 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with increased spontaneous calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and linked to increased adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) expression and activation. Here we tested whether this may favor atrial arrhythmogenesis by promoting beat-to-beat alternation and irregularity. Patch-clamp and confocal calcium imaging was used to measure the beat-to-beat response of the calcium current and transient in human atrial myocytes. Responses were classified as uniform, alternating or irregular and stimulation of Gs-protein coupled receptors decreased the frequency where a uniform response could be maintained from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 0.6 +/- 0.1 Hz; p &lt; 0.01 for beta-adrenergic receptors and from 1.4 +/- 0.1 to 0.5 +/- 0.1 Hz; p &lt; 0.05 for A2ARs. The latter was linked to increased spontaneous calcium release and after-depolarizations. Moreover, A2AR activation increased the fraction of non-uniformly responding cells in HL-1 myocyte cultures from 19 +/- 3 to 51 +/- 9 %; p &lt; 0.02, and electrical mapping in perfused porcine atria revealed that adenosine induced electrical alternans at longer cycle lengths, doubled the fraction of electrodes showing alternation, and increased the amplitude of alternations. Importantly, protein kinase A inhibition increased the highest frequency where uniform responses could be maintained from 0.84 +/- 0.12 to 1.86 +/- 0.11 Hz; p &lt; 0.001 and prevention of A2AR-activation with exogenous adenosine deaminase selectively increased the threshold from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 Hz; p = 0.001 in myocytes from patients with AF. In conclusion, A2AR-activation promotes beat-to-beat irregularities in the calcium transient in human atrial myocytes, and prevention of A2AR activation may be a novel means to maintain uniform beat-to-beat responses at higher beating frequencies in patients with atrial fibrillation.

TI - Aberrant DNA methylation in non-small cell lung cancer-associated fibroblasts
AB - DNA methylation profiling of TAFs reveals global demethylation and a selective impact on the TGF-beta pathway. Moreover, it suggests the fibrocyte origin of a fraction of TAFs, and identifies a novel prognostic biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer.Epigenetic changes through altered DNA methylation have been implicated in critical aspects of tumor progression, and have been extensively studied in a variety of cancer types. In contrast, our current knowledge of the aberrant genomic DNA methylation in tumor-associated fibroblasts (TAFs) or other stromal cells that act as critical coconspirators of tumor progression is very scarce. To address this gap of knowledge, we conducted genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on lung TAFs and paired control fibroblasts (CFs) from non-small cell lung cancer patients using the HumanMethylation450 microarray. We found widespread DNA hypomethylation concomitant with focal gain of DNA methylation in TAFs compared to CFs. The aberrant DNA methylation landscape of TAFs had a global impact on gene expression and a selective impact on the TGF-beta pathway. The latter included promoter hypermethylation-associated SMAD3 silencing, which was associated with hyperresponsiveness to exogenous TGF-beta 1 in terms of contractility and extracellular matrix deposition. In turn, activation of CFs with exogenous TGF-beta 1 partially mimicked the epigenetic alterations observed in TAFs, suggesting that TGF-beta 1 may be necessary but not sufficient to elicit such alterations. Moreover, integrated pathway-enrichment analyses of the DNA methylation alterations revealed that a fraction of TAFs may be bone marrow-derived fibrocytes. Finally, survival analyses using DNA methylation and gene expression datasets identified aberrant DNA methylation on the EDARADD promoter sequence as a prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Our findings shed light on the unique origin and molecular alterations underlying the aberrant phenotype of lung TAFs, and identify a stromal biomarker with potential clinical relevance.

TI - Learning of chunking sequences in cognition and behavior
AB - We often learn and recall long sequences in smaller segments, such as a phone number 858 534 22 30 memorized as four segments. Behavioral experiments suggest that humans and some animals employ this strategy of breaking down cognitive or behavioral sequences into chunks in a wide variety of tasks, but the dynamical principles of how this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we study the temporal dynamics of chunking for learning cognitive sequences in a chunking representation using a dynamical model of competing modes arranged to evoke hierarchical Winnerless Competition (WLC) dynamics. Sequential memory is represented as trajectories along a chain of metastable fixed points at each level of the hierarchy, and bistable Hebbian dynamics enables the learning of such trajectories in an unsupervised fashion. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate the learning of a chunking representation of sequences and their robust recall. During learning, the dynamics associates a set of modes to each information-carrying item in the sequence and encodes their relative order. During recall, hierarchical WLC guarantees the robustness of the sequence order when the sequence is not too long. The resulting patterns of activities share several features observed in behavioral experiments, such as the pauses between boundaries of chunks, their size and their duration. Failures in learning chunking sequences provide new insights into the dynamical causes of neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia.

TI - Sequence information gain based motif analysis
AB - Background: The detection of regulatory regions in candidate sequences is essential for the understanding of the regulation of a particular gene and the mechanisms involved. This paper proposes a novel methodology based on information theoretic metrics for finding regulatory sequences in promoter regions. Results: This methodology (SIGMA) has been tested on genomic sequence data for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SIGMA has been compared with different publicly available alternatives for motif detection, such as MEME/MAST, Biostrings (Bioconductor package), MotifRegressor, and previous work such Qresiduals projections or information theoretic based detectors. Comparative results, in the form of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves, show how, in 70 % of the studied Transcription Factor Binding Sites, the SIGMA detector has a better performance and behaves more robustly than the methods compared, while having a similar computational time. The performance of SIGMA can be explained by its parametric simplicity in the modelling of the non-linear co-variability in the binding motif positions. Conclusions: Sequence Information Gain based Motif Analysis is a generalisation of a non-linear model of the cis-regulatory sequences detection based on Information Theory. This generalisation allows us to detect transcription factor binding sites with maximum performance disregarding the covariability observed in the positions of the training set of sequences. SIGMA is freely available to the public at http://b2slab.upc.edu.

TI - Compound identification in gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomics by blind source separation
AB - Metabolomics GC-MS samples involve high complexity data that must be effectively resolved to produce chemically meaningful results. Multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) is the most frequently reported technique for that purpose. More recently, independent component analysis (ICA) has been reported as an alternative to MCR. Those algorithms attempt to infer a model describing the observed data and, therefore, the least squares regression used in MCR assumes that the data is a linear combination of that model. However, due to the high complexity of real data, the construction of a model to describe optimally the observed data is a critical step and these algorithms should prevent the influence from outlier data. This study proves independent component regression (ICR) as an alternative for GC-MS compound identification. Both ICR and MCR though require least squares regression to correctly resolve the mixtures. In this paper, a novel orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD) approach is introduced, which uses principal component analysis to determine the compound spectra. The study includes a compound identification comparison between the results by ICA-OSD, MCR-OSD, ICR and MCR-ALS using pure standards and human serum samples. Results shows that ICR may be used as an alternative to multivariate curve methods, as ICR efficiency is comparable to MCR-ALS. Also, the study demonstrates that the proposed OSD approach achieves greater spectral resolution accuracy than the traditional least squares approach when compounds elute under undue interference of biological matrices.

TI - Distribution and function of cardiac ryanodine receptor clusters in live ventricular myocytes
AB - The cardiac Ca2+ release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR2) plays an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells. Effective and stable excitation-contraction coupling critically depends not only on the expression of RyR2, but also on its distribution. Despite its importance, little is known about the distribution and organization of RyR2 in living cells. To study the distribution of RyR2 in living cardiomyocytes, we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing a GFP-tagged RyR2 (GFP-RyR2). Confocal imaging of live ventricular myocytes isolated from the GFP-RyR2 mouse heart revealed clusters of GFP-RyR2 organized in rows with a striated pattern. Similar organization of GFP-RyR2 clusters was observed in fixed ventricular myocytes. Immunofluorescence staining with the anti-alpha-actinin antibody (a z-line marker) showed that nearly all GFP-RyR2 clusters were localized in the z-line zone. There were small regions with dislocated GFP-RyR2 clusters. Interestingly, these same regions also displayed dislocated z-lines. Staining with di-8-ANEPPS revealed that nearly all GFP-RyR2 clusters were co-localized with transverse but not longitudinal tubules, whereas staining with MitoTracker Red showed that GFP-RyR2 clusters were not co-localized with mitochondria in live ventricular myocytes. We also found GFP-RyR2 clusters interspersed between z-lines only at the periphery of live ventricular myocytes. Simultaneous detection of GFP-RyR2 clusters and Ca2+ sparks showed that Ca2+ sparks originated exclusively from RyR2 clusters. Ca2+ sparks from RyR2 clusters induced no detectable changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ level. These results reveal, for the first time, the distribution of RyR2 clusters and its functional correlation in living ventricular myocytes.

While the computational advantages of high frequency sampling have not been yet elucidated, here, in order to motivate further investigation in active sampling strategies, we share the data from an artificial olfactory system made of 16 MOX gas sensors under gas flow modulation. The data were acquired on a custom set up featured by an external mechanical ventilator that emulates the biological respiration cycle. 58 samples were recorded in response to a relatively broad set of 12 gas classes, defined from different binary mixtures of acetone and ethanol in air. The acquired time series show two dominant frequency bands: the low-frequency signal corresponds to a conventional response curve of a sensor in response to a gas pulse, and the high-frequency signal has a clear principal harmonic at the respiration frequency. The data are related to the study in [1], and the data analysis results reported there should be considered as a reference point.

TI - Synthetic benchmarks for machine olfaction: Classification, segmentation and sensor damage
AB - The design of the signal and data processing algorithms requires a validation stage and some data relevant for a validation procedure. While the practice to share public data sets and make use of them is a recent and still on-going activity in the community, the synthetic benchmarks presented here are an option for the researches, who need data for testing and comparing the algorithms under development. The collection of synthetic benchmark data sets were generated for classification, segmentation and sensor damage scenarios, each defined at 5 difficulty levels. The published data are related to the data simulation tool, which was used to create a virtual array of 1020 sensors with a default set of parameters

TI - Characterization of daytime sleepiness by time-frequency measures of EEG signals
AB - Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the main symptoms of several sleep-related disorders with a great impact on patient lives. While many studies have been carried out in order to assess daytime sleepiness, automatic EDS detection still remains an open problem. In this work, a detection approach based on the time-frequency analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) signals is proposed. Multichannel EEG signals were recorded during five maintenance of wakefulness (MWT) and multiple sleep latency tests alternated throughout the day from patients suffering from sleep-disordered breathing. A group of 20 patients with EDS was compared with a group of 20 patients without daytime sleepiness (WDS) by analyzing 60-s EEG windows in the waking state. Measures obtained from the Choi-Williams distribution (CWD) and the cross-CWD were calculated in the EEG frequency bands delta (0.1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (12-30 Hz), and total band (TB, 0.1-45 Hz). Statistical differences between EDS and WDS groups were found in the delta and theta bands during MWT events (p < 0.0001). The results show that the EDS group presented more power in the theta band, while the WDS group presented higher spectral and cross-spectral entropy in the frontal zone in the delta band. In general, CWD and cross-CWD measures yielded sensitivities and specificities of above 80 %. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was above 0.85 for classifying EDS and WDS patients.

TI - Prediction of nociceptive responses during sedation by linear and non-linear measures of EEG signals in high frequencies
AB - The level of sedation in patients undergoing medical procedures evolves continuously, affected by the interaction between the effect of the anesthetic and analgesic agents and the pain stimuli. The monitors of depth of anesthesia, based on the analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG), have been progressively introduced into the daily practice to provide additional information about the state of the patient. However, the quantification of analgesia still remains an open problem. The purpose of this work is to improve the prediction of nociceptive responses with linear and non-linear measures calculated from EEG signal filtered in frequency bands higher than the traditional bands. Power spectral density and auto-mutual information function was applied in order to predict the presence or absence of the nociceptive responses to different stimuli during sedation in endoscopy procedure. The proposed measures exhibit better performances than the bispectral index (BIS). Values of prediction probability of P-k above 0.75 and percentages of sensitivity and specificity above 70% were achieved combining EEG measures from the traditional frequency bands and higher frequency bands.

TI - Reservoir computing compensates slow response of chemosensor arrays exposed to fast varying gas concentrations in continuous monitoring
AB - Metal oxide (MOX) gas sensors arrays are a predominant technological choice to perform fundamental tasks of chemical detection. Yet, their use has been mainly limited to relatively controlled instrument configurations where the sensor array is placed within a closed measurement chamber. Usually, the experimental protocol is defined beforehand and it includes three stages: the array is first exposed to a gas reference, then to the gas sample, and finally to the reference again to recover the initial state. Such sampling procedure requires signal acquisition during the complete experimental protocol and usually delays the output prediction until the predefined measurement duration is complete. Due to the slow time response of chemical sensors, the completion of the measurement typically requires minutes. In this paper we propose the use of reservoir computing (RC) algorithms to overcome the slow temporal dynamics of chemical sensor arrays, allowing identification and quantification of chemicals of interest continuously and reducing measurement delays. We generated two datasets to test the ability of RC algorithms to provide accurate and continuous prediction to fast varying gas concentrations in real time. Both datasets - one generated with synthetic data and the other acquired from actual gas sensors - provide time series of MOX sensors exposed to binary gas mixtures where concentration levels change randomly over time. Our results show that our approach improves the time response of the sensory system and provides accurate predictions in real time, making the system specifically suitable for online monitoring applications. Finally, the collected dataset and developed code are made publicly available to the research community for further studies.

TI - Time-varying signal analysis to detect high-altitude periodic breathing in climbers ascending to extreme altitude
AB - This work investigates the performance of cardiorespiratory analysis detecting periodic breathing (PB) in chest wall recordings in mountaineers climbing to extreme altitude. The breathing patterns of 34 mountaineers were monitored unobtrusively by inductance plethysmography, ECG and pulse oximetry using a portable recorder during
climbs at altitudes between 4497 and 7546 m on Mt. Muztagh Ata. The minute ventilation (VE) and heart rate (HR) signals were studied, to identify visually scored PB, applying time-varying spectral, coherence and entropy
analysis. In 411 climbing periods, 30-120 min in duration, high values of mean power (MPVE) and slope (MSlopeVE)
of the modulation frequency band of VE, accurately identified PB, with an area under the ROC curve of 88 and 89 %,
respectively. Prolonged stay at altitude was associated with an increase in PB. During PB episodes, higher peak power
of ventilatory (MPVE) and cardiac (MPLF
HR) oscillations and cardiorespiratory coherence (MPLFCoher), but reduced ventilation entropy (SampEnVE), was observed. Therefore, the characterization of cardiorespiratory dynamics by the analysis of VE and HR signals accurately identifies PB and
effects of altitude acclimatization, providing promising tools for investigating physiologic effects of environmental
exposures and diseases.

TI - Symbolic dynamics to discriminate healthy and ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy populations: An application to the variability of heart period and QT interval
AB - Myocardial ischaemia is hypothesized to stimulate the cardiac sympathetic excitatory afferents and, therefore, the spontaneous changes of heart period (approximated as the RR interval), and the QT interval in ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) patients might reflect this sympathetic activation. Symbolic analysis is a nonlinear and powerful tool for the extraction and classification of patterns in time-series analysis, which implies a transformation of the original series into symbols and the construction of patterns with the symbols. The aim of this work was to investigate whether symbolic transformations of RR and QT cardiac series can provide a better separation between IDC patients and healthy control (HC) subjects compared with traditional linear measures. The variability of these cardiac series was studied during daytime and night-time periods and also during the complete 24 h recording over windows of short data sequences of approximately 5 min. The IDC group was characterized by an increase in the occurrence rate of patterns without variations (0V%) and a reduction in the occurrence rate of patterns with one variation (1 V%) and two variations (2V%). Concerning the RR variability during the daytime, the highest number of patterns had 0V%, whereas the rates of 1V% and 2V% were lower. During the night, 1V% and 2V% increased at the expense of diminishing 0V%. Patterns with and without variations between consecutive symbols were able to increase the separation between the IDC and HC groups, allowing accuracies higher than 80%. With regard to entropy measures, an increase in RR regularity was associated with cardiac disease described by accuracy > 70% in the RR series and by accuracy > 60% in the QTc series. These results could be associated with an increase in the sympathetic tone in IDC patients.

TI - Evaluation of acceleration and deceleration cardiac processes using phase-rectified signal averaging in healthy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy subjects
AB - The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of the Phase-Rectified Signal Averaging (PRSA) method for improved risk prediction in cardiac patients. Moreover, this technique, which separately evaluates acceleration and deceleration processes of cardiac rhythm, allows the effect of sympathetic and vagal modulations of beat-to-beat intervals to be characterized. Holter recordings of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) patients were analyzed: high-risk (HR), who suffered sudden cardiac death (SCD) during the follow-up; and low-risk (LR), without any kind of cardiac-related death. Moreover, a control group of healthy subjects was analyzed. PRSA indexes were analyzed, for different time scales T and wavelet scales s, from RR series of 24 h-ECG recordings, awake periods and sleep periods. Also, the behavior of these indexes from simulated data was analyzed and compared with real data results. Outcomes demonstrated the PRSA capacity to significantly discriminate healthy subjects from IDC patients and HR from LR patients on a higher level than traditional temporal and spectral measures. The behavior of PRSA indexes agrees with experimental evidences related to cardiac autonomic modulations. Also, these parameters reflect more regularity of the autonomic nervous system CANS) in HR patients. (C) 2015 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI - Bioinspired early detection through gas flow modulation in chemo-sensory systems
AB - The design of bioinspired systems for chemical sensing is an engaging line of research in machine olfaction. Developments in this line could increase the lifetime and sensitivity of artificial chemo-sensory systems. Such approach is based on the sensory systems known in live organisms, and the resulting developed artificial systems are targeted to reproduce the biological mechanisms to some extent. Sniffing behaviour, sampling odours actively, has been studied recently in neuroscience, and it has been suggested that the respiration frequency is an important parameter of the olfactory system, since the odour perception, especially in complex scenarios such as novel odourants exploration, depends on both the stimulus identity and the sampling method. In this work we propose a chemical sensing system based on an array of 16 metal-oxide gas sensors that we combined with an external mechanical ventilator to simulate the biological respiration cycle. The tested gas classes formed a relatively broad combination of two analytes, acetone and ethanol, in binary mixtures. Two sets of low-frequency and high-frequency features were extracted from the acquired signals to show that the high-frequency features contain information related to the gas class. In addition, such information is available at early stages of the measurement, which could make the technique suitable in early detection scenarios. The full data set is made publicly available to the community. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI - Algorithm for automatic forced spirometry quality assessment: Technological developments
AB - We hypothesized that the implementation of automatic real-time assessment of quality of forced spirometry (FS) may significantly enhance the potential for extensive deployment of a FS program in the community. Recent studies have demonstrated that the application of quality criteria defined by the ATS/ERS (American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society) in commercially available equipment with automatic quality assessment can be markedly improved. To this end, an algorithm for assessing quality of FS automatically was reported. The current research describes the mathematical developments of the algorithm. An innovative analysis of the shape of the spirometric curve, adding 23 new metrics to the traditional 4 recommended by ATS/ERS, was done. The algorithm was created through a two-step iterative process including: (1) an initial version using the standard FS curves recommended by the ATS; and, (2) a refined version using curves from patients. In each of these steps the results were assessed against one expert's opinion. Finally, an independent set of FS curves from 291 patients was used for validation purposes. The novel mathematical approach to characterize the FS curves led to appropriate FS classification with high specificity (95%) and sensitivity (96%). The results constitute the basis for a successful transfer of FS testing to non-specialized professionals in the community.

TI - Clinical decision support system to enhance quality control of forced spirometry using information and communication technologies
AB - Background: We recently demonstrated that quality of spirometry in primary care could markedly improve with remote offline support from specialized professionals. It is hypothesized that implementation of automatic online assessment of quality of spirometry using information and communication technologies may significantly enhance the potential for extensive deployment of a high quality spirometry program in integrated care settings.
Objective: The objective of the study was to elaborate and validate a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for automatic online quality assessment of spirometry.
Methods: The CDSS was done through a three step process including: (1) identification of optimal sampling frequency; (2) iterations to build-up an initial version using the 24 standard spirometry curves recommended by the American Thoracic Society; and (3) iterations to refine the CDSS using 270 curves from 90 patients. In each of these steps the results were checked against one expert. Finally, 778 spirometry curves from 291 patients were analyzed for validation purposes.
Results: The CDSS generated appropriate online classification and certification in 685/778 (88.1%) of spirometry testing, with 96% sensitivity and 95% specificity.
Conclusions: Consequently, only 93/778 (11.9%) of spirometry testing required offline remote classification by an expert, indicating a potential positive role of the CDSS in the deployment of a high quality spirometry program in an integrated care setting.

TI - Chemical discrimination in turbulent gas mixtures with MOX sensors validated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
AB - Chemical detection systems based on chemo-resistive sensors usually include a gas chamber to control the sample air flow and to minimize turbulence. However, such a kind of experimental setup does not reproduce the gas concentration fluctuations observed in natural environments and destroys the spatio-temporal information contained in gas plumes. Aiming at reproducing more realistic environments, we utilize a wind tunnel with two independent gas sources that get naturally mixed along a turbulent flow. For the first time, chemo-resistive gas sensors are exposed to dynamic gas mixtures generated with several concentration levels at the sources. Moreover, the ground truth of gas concentrations at the sensor location was estimated by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We used a support vector machine as a tool to show that chemo-resistive transduction can be utilized to reliably identify chemical components in dynamic turbulent mixtures, as long as sufficient gas concentration coverage is used. We show that in open sampling systems, training the classifiers only on high concentrations of gases produces less effective classification and that it is important to calibrate the classification method with data at low gas concentrations to achieve optimal performance

TI - Intensity drift removal in LC/MS metabolomics by common variance compensation
AB - Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC/MS) has become widely used in Metabolomics. Several artefacts have been identified during the acquisition step in large LC/MS metabolomics experiments, including ion suppression, carryover or changes in the sensitivity and intensity. Several sources have been pointed out as responsible for these effects. In this context, the drift effects of the peak intensity is one of the most frequent and may even constitute the main source of variance in the data, resulting in misleading statistical results when the samples are analysed. In this article, we propose the introduction of a methodology based on a common variance analysis before the data normalization to address this issue. This methodology was tested and compared with four other methods by calculating the Dunn and Silhouette indices of the quality control classes. The results showed that our proposed methodology performed better than any of the other four methods. As far as we know, this is the first time that this kind of approach has been applied in the metabolomics context.

TI - Correntropy measures to detect daytime sleepiness from EEG signals
AB - Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the main symptoms of several sleep related disorders and has a great impact on patients' lives. While many studies have been carried out in order to assess daytime sleepiness, automatic EDS detection still remains an open problem. In this work, a novel approach to this issue based on correntropy function analysis of EEG signals was proposed in order to detect patients suffering from EDS. Multichannel EEG signals were recorded during five Maintenance of Wakefulness Tests (MWT) and Multiple Sleep Latency Tests (MSLT) alternated throughout the day for patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing (SDB). A group of 20 patients with EDS was compared with a group of 20 patients without daytime sleepiness (WDS), by analyzing 60s EEG windows in a waking state. Measures obtained from the cross-correntropy function (CCORR) and auto-correntropy function (ACORR) were calculated in the EEG frequency bands: delta, 0.1-4 Hz;., 4-8 Hz; alpha, 8-12 Hz; beta, 12-30 Hz; total band TB, 0.1-45 Hz. These functions permitted the quantification of complex signal properties and the non-linear couplings between different areas of the scalp. Statistical differences between EDS and WDS groups were mainly found in the beta band during MSLT events (p-value < 0.0001). The WDS group presented more complexity in the occipital zone than the EDS group, while a stronger nonlinear coupling between the occipital and frontal regions was detected in EDS patients than in the WDS group. At best, ACORR and CCORR measures yielded sensitivity and specificity above 80% and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was above 0.85 in classifying EDS and WDS patients. These performances represent an improvement with respect to classical EEG indices applied in the same database (sensitivity and specificity were never above 80% and AUC was under 0.75).

TI - Evaluation of very low amplitude intra-QRS potentials during the initial minutes of acute transmural myocardial ischemia
AB - Introduction: Low-level electrocardiographic changes from depolarization wavefront may accompany acute myocardial ischemia. The purpose of this study was to assess the changes of microvolt amplitude intra-QRS potentials induced by elective percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI).; Methods: Fifty-seven patients with balloon inflation periods ranging from 3.1 to 7.3 minutes (4.9 +/- 0.7 min) were studied. Nine leads continuous high-resolution ECG before and during PCI were recorded and signal-averaged. Abnormal intra-QRS at microvolt level (mu AIQP) were obtained using a signal modeling approach. mu AIQP, R-wave amplitude and QRS duration were measured in the processed ECG during baseline and PCI episodes.; Results: The mean mu AIQP amplitude significantly decreased for each of the standard 12 leads at the PCI event respect to baseline. Left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion resulted in a decrease mu AIQP in both the precordial leads and the limb leads, while right coronary (RCA) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries occlusions mainly affected limb leads. R-wave amplitude increased during PCI in RCA and LCx groups in lead III but decreased in the precordial leads, while the amplitude decreased in the LAD group in lead III. The average duration of the QRS augmented in groups RCA and LCx but not in the LAD group.; Conclusions: Abnormal intra-QRS potentials at the level of mu V provide an excellent tool to characterize the very-low amplitude fragmentation of the QRS complex and its changes due to ischemic injuries. mu AIQP shows promise as a new ECG index to measure electrophysiologic changes associated with acute myocardial ischemia.

TI - Automatic capacitor bank identification in power distribution systems
AB - Tracking the performance and health of capacitor banks in distribution systems is a challenging task due to their high number and the widespread geographical distribution of feeder circuits. In this work we propose a signal processing technique capable of identifying and characterizing the number of capacitor banks connected to a standard North-American feeder circuit. The way the technique is applied allows a real-time remote monitoring of their operation, automatically identifying the switching activity for each capacitor bank connected. The technique is based on an unsupervised clustering of the three phase reactance step magnitudes. We demonstrate that using only passive monitoring of conventional substation bus PTs and feeder CTs, without any communication, nor visual inspection, to individual banks, it is possible to predict the number of capacitor banks on the distribution feeder and track their performance and activity over time.

TI - Measuring instantaneous and spectral information entropies by shannon entropy of choi-williams distribution in the context of electroencephalography
AB - The theory of Shannon entropy was applied to the Choi-Williams time-frequency distribution (CWD) of time series in order to extract entropy information in both time and frequency domains. In this way, four novel indexes were defined: (1) partial instantaneous entropy, calculated as the entropy of the CWD with respect to time by using the probability mass function at each time instant taken independently; (2) partial spectral information entropy, calculated as the entropy of the CWD with respect to frequency by using the probability mass function of each frequency value taken independently; (3) complete instantaneous entropy, calculated as the entropy of the CWD with respect to time by using the probability mass function of the entire CWD; (4) complete spectral information entropy, calculated as the entropy of the CWD with respect to frequency by using the probability mass function of the entire CWD. These indexes were tested on synthetic time series with different behavior (periodic, chaotic and random) and on a dataset of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals recorded in different states (eyes-open, eyes-closed, ictal and non-ictal activity). The results have shown that the values of these indexes tend to decrease, with different proportion, when the behavior of the synthetic signals evolved from chaos or randomness to periodicity. Statistical differences (p-value < 0.0005) were found between values of these measures comparing eyes-open and eyes-closed states and between ictal and non-ictal states in the traditional EEG frequency bands. Finally, this paper has demonstrated that the proposed measures can be useful tools to quantify the different periodic, chaotic and random components in EEG signals.

TI - LTI ODE-valued neural networks
AB - A dynamical version of the classical McCulloch & Pitts' neural model is introduced in this paper. In this new approach, artificial neurons are characterized by: i) inputs in the form of differentiable continuous-time signals, ii) linear time-invariant ordinary differential equations (LTI ODE) for connection weights, and iii) activation functions evaluated in the frequency domain. It will be shown that this new characterization of the constitutive nodes in an artificial neural network, namely LTI ODE-valued neural network (LTI ODEVNN), allows solving multiple problems at the same time using a single neural structure. Moreover, it is demonstrated that LTI ODEVNNs can be interpreted as complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs). Hence, research on this topic can be applied in a straightforward form. Standard boolean functions are implemented to illustrate the operation of LTI ODEVNNs. Concluding the paper, several future research lines are highlighted, including the need for developing learning algorithms for the newly introduced LTI ODEVNNs.

TI - Multiscale complexity analysis of the cardiac control identifies asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in long QT syndrome type 1
AB - The study assesses complexity of the cardiac control directed to the sinus node and to ventricles in long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1) patients with KCNQ1-A341V mutation. Complexity was assessed via refined multiscale entropy (RMSE) computed over the beat-to-beat variability series of heart period (HP) and QT interval. HP and QT interval were approximated respectively as the temporal distance between two consecutive R-wave peaks and between the R-wave apex and T-wave end. Both measures were automatically taken from 24-hour electrocardiographic Holter traces recorded during daily activities in non mutation carriers (NMCs, n = 14) and mutation carriers (MCs, n = 34) belonging to a South African LQT1 founder population. The MC group was divided into asymptomatic (ASYMP, n = 11) and symptomatic (SYMP, n = 23) patients according to the symptom severity. Analyses were carried out during daytime (DAY, from 2PM to 6PM) and nighttime (NIGHT, from 12PM to 4AM) off and on beta-adrenergic blockade (BBoff and BBon). We found that the complexity of the HP variability at short time scale was under vagal control, being significantly increased during NIGHT and BBon both in ASYMP and SYMP groups, while the complexity of both HP and QT variability at long time scales was under sympathetic control, being smaller during NIGHT and BBon in SYMP subjects. Complexity indexes at long time scales in ASYMP individuals were smaller than those in SYMP ones regardless of therapy (i.e. BBoff or BBon), thus suggesting that a reduced complexity of the sympathetic regulation is protective in ASYMP individuals. RMSE analysis of HP and QT interval variability derived from routine 24-hour electrocardiographic Holter recordings might provide additional insights into the physiology of the cardiac control and might be fruitfully exploited to improve risk stratification in LQT1 population.

TI - Human activity monitoring using gas sensor arrays
AB - A chemical detection system made of a gas sensor array and algorithms intended to monitor human activity was tested in a NASA spacecraft cabin simulator. Such a chemical-based monitoring system, if extended to home settings, would allow the autonomous detection of emergency situations, thereby postponing the moving of elderly people to assisted living facilities and improving their quality of life. Moreover, in contrast to other monitoring systems based on wearable sensors or video cameras, a monitoring system based on measuring changes in air composition induced by human activities would be non-invasive and would not raise privacy concerns when installed in homes. The third generation of the JPL sensor array was adapted in a small, compact and portable system and deployed in a spacecraft-like room for four weeks while volunteers were performing daily routines. The system was able to predict the total number of people and the level of activity performed in the room, while detecting unexpectedly high concentrations of volatiles

TI - Filtering and thresholding the analytic signal envelope in order to improve peak and spike noise reduction in EEG signals
AB - To remove peak and spike artifacts in biological time series has represented a hard challenge in the last decades. Several methods have been implemented mainly based on adaptive filtering in order to solve this problem. This work presents an algorithm for removing peak and spike artifacts based on a threshold built on the analytic signal envelope. The algorithm was tested on simulated and real EEG signals that contain peak and spike artifacts with random amplitude and frequency occurrence. The performance of the filter was compared with commonly used adaptive filters. Three indexes were used for testing the performance of the filters: Correlation coefficient (p), mean of coherence function (C), and rate of absolute error (RAE). All these indexes were calculated between filtered signal and original signal without noise. It was found that the new proposed filter was able to reduce the amplitude of peak and spike artifacts with rho > 0.85, C > 0.8, and RAE < 0.5. These values were significantly better than the performance of LMS adaptive filter (rho < 0.85, C < 0.6, and RAE > 1). (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI - Data simulation in machine olfaction with the R package chemosensors
AB - In machine olfaction, the design of applications based on gas sensor arrays is highly dependent on the robustness of the signal and data processing algorithms. While the practice of testing the algorithms on public benchmarks is not common in the field, we propose software for performing data simulations in the machine olfaction field by generating parameterized sensor array data. The software is implemented as an R language package chemosensors which is open-access, platform-independent and self-contained. We introduce the concept of a virtual sensor array which can be used as a data generation tool. In this work, we describe the data simulation workflow which basically consists of scenario definition, virtual array parameterization and the generation of sensor array data. We also give examples of the processing of the simulated data as proof of concept for the parameterized sensor array data: the benchmarking of classification algorithms, the evaluation of linear- and non-linear regression algorithms, and the biologically inspired processing of sensor array data. All the results presented were obtained under version 0.7.6 of the chemosensors package whose home page is chemosensors.r-forge.r-project.org.

TI - Estimation of the limit of detection using information theory measures
AB - Definitions of the limit of detection (LOD) based on the probability of false positive and/or false negative errors have been proposed over the past years. Although such definitions are straightforward and valid for any kind of analytical system, proposed methodologies to estimate the LOD are usually simplified to signals with Gaussian noise. Additionally, there is a general misconception that two systems with the same LOD provide the same amount of information on the source regardless of the prior probability of presenting a blank/analyte sample. Based upon an analogy between an analytical system and a binary communication channel, in this paper we show that the amount of information that can be extracted from an analytical system depends on the probability of presenting the two different possible states. We propose a new definition of LOD utilizing information theory tools that deals with noise of any kind and allows the introduction of prior knowledge easily. Unlike most traditional LOD estimation approaches, the proposed definition is based on the amount of information that the chemical instrumentation system provides on the chemical information source. Our findings indicate that the benchmark of analytical systems based on the ability to provide information about the presence/absence of the analyte (our proposed approach) is a more general and proper framework, while converging to the usual values when dealing with Gaussian noise.

TI - On the calibration of sensor arrays for pattern recognition using the minimal number of experiments
AB - Weinvestigate optimal experiment selection to train a classifier on gas sensor arrays to get the maximal possible performance in a limited number of experiments. In gas sensing, while collecting data for a particular sensor array, one has to choose what gas and concentration level is going to be presented in the next experiment. It is an active decision by the operator selecting the experiments and training the classifiers. Can the algorithm be trained sooner rather than later? Can we minimize the costs of collecting the data in terms of the man-hour of the operator and the expenses of the experiment itself? Active control sampling provides a way to deal with the challenge of minimizing the calibration costs and is applicable to any situation where experimental selection is parameterized by an external control variable. Our results indicate that active sampling strategies can only improve a random selection of experiments over a wide range of concentration of gasses. However, random or uninformed selection is fairly close. Additionally, our active sampling methodology reveals that, when there is no prior knowledge about the range of concentrations to which the sensor will be exposed during real operation, sensor must be calibrated over the entire working range, not just high concentrations. In fact, our results show that it is especially important to include low concentrations in the calibration since the lack of these values would dramatically decrease the performance of the system.

AB - Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on "Biosignal Interpretation: Advanced Methods for Neural Signals and Images". Objectives: An efficient way to investigate the neural basis of nociceptive responses is the analysis of the event-related brain potentials (ERPs). The main objective of this work was to study how adaptation and fatigue affect the ERPs to stimuli of different modalities, by characterizing the responses to infrequent and frequent stimulation in different recording periods. Methods: In this work, series of averaged EEG epochs recorded after thermal, electrical and auditory stimulation were analyzed with time-frequency representation and non-linear measures as spectral entropy and auto-mutual information function. The study was performed by considering the traditional EEG frequency bands. Results: The defined measures presented a statistical significance p-value < 0.01 and accuracy higher than 60% by differentiating windows of response to infrequent (I) and frequent (F) stimuli between the start and end of the EEG recording. Conclusions: These measures permitted to observe some aspects of the subject's adaptation and the nociceptive response

TI - Short-term vs.long-term heart rate variability in ischemic cardiomyopathy risk stratification
AB - In industrialized countries with aging populations, heart failure affects 0.3-2% of the general population. The investigation of 24 h-ECG recordings revealed the potential of nonlinear indices of heart rate variability (HRV) for enhanced risk stratification in patients with ischemic heart failure (IHF). However, long-term analyses are time-consuming, expensive, and delay the initial diagnosis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether 30 min short-term HRV analysis is sufficient for comparable risk stratification in IHF in comparison to 24 h-HRV analysis. From 256 IHF patients [221 at low risk (IHFLR) and 35 at high risk (IHFHR)] (a) 24 h beat-to-beat time series (b) the first 30 min segment (c) the 30 min most stationary day segment and (d) the 30 min most stationary night segment were investigated. We calculated linear (time and frequency domain) and nonlinear HRV analysis indices. Optimal parameter sets for risk stratification in IHF were determined for 24 h and for each 30 min segment by applying discriminant analysis on significant clinical and non-clinical indices. Long- and short-term HRV indices from frequency domain and particularly from nonlinear dynamics revealed high univariate significances (p < 0.01) discriminating between IHFLR and IHFHR. For multivariate risk stratification, optimal mixed parameter sets consisting of 5 indices (clinical and nonlinear) achieved 80.4% AUC (area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics) from 24 h HRV analysis, 84.3% AUC from first 30 min, 82.2 % AUC from daytime 30 min and 81.7% AUC from nighttime 30 min. The optimal parameter set obtained from the first 30 min showed nearly the same classification power when compared to the optimal 24 h-parameter set. As results from stationary daytime and nighttime, 30 min segments indicate that short-term analyses of 30 min may provide at least a comparable risk stratification power in IHF in comparison to a 24 h analysis period.

TI - Complexity of the autonomic heart rate control in coronary artery occlusion in patients with and without prior myocardial infarction
AB - Autonomic nervous system (ANS) is governed by complex interactions arising from feedback loops of nonlinear systems that operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, enabling the organism to adapt to stress, metabolic changes and diseases. This study is aimed to assess multifractal and nonlinear characteristics of the ANS during ischemic events provoked by a prolonged percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure. Eighty-seven patients from the STAFF III database were used. Patients were classified into 2 groups: (1) with prior myocardial infarction (MI) and (2) without MI (noMI). R-R signals during three 3-min stages of the procedures were analyzed using multifractal and surrogate data techniques. Multifractal indices increased significantly from the pre-inflation stage to the post-deflation stage. These variations were more marked for the noMI group. Multifractal changes significantly correlated with both the decreased parasympathetic and the increased sympathetic modulations accounted by classical linear indices. Multifractal measures resulted to be a more powerful indicator than linear HRV indices in quantifying the ischemia-induced changes. Right coronary artery (RCA) occlusions provoke greater multifractal reactions throughout the PCI procedure. Our findings suggest reduced complex multifractal and nonlinear reactions of ANS activity in patients with prior MI in comparison to the noMI group, possibly due to degradation in the complexity of control mechanism of heart rate generation

AB - Cross-species sequence comparisons have suggested that cross-species sequence variability is correlated with functionality. The goal of this study was to extend this observation at different genetic regions, focusing on the morbidity of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). A set of deleterious SNPs was compared to a set of neutral SNPs. Both samples were stratified according to the location of the SNPs at different genetic regions. Deleterious SNPs were observed to be less variable across species than neutral SNPs, these differences being significant for missense mutations (p=1.1x10-9p=1.1x10-9), SNPs in introns (p=6.4x10-3p=6.4x10-3), and SNPs in unknown regions (p=8x10-4p=8x10-4).

TI - Predictability of gene ontology slim-terms from primary structure information in Embryophyta plant proteins
AB - Proteins are the key elements on the path from genetic information to the development of life. The roles played by the different proteins are difficult to uncover experimentally as this process involves complex procedures such as genetic modifications, injection of fluorescent proteins, gene knock-out methods and others. The knowledge learned from each protein is usually annotated in databases through different methods such as the proposed by The Gene Ontology (GO) consortium. Different methods have been proposed in order to predict GO terms from primary structure information, but very few are available for large-scale functional annotation of plants, and reported success rates are much less than the reported by other non-plant predictors. This paper explores the predictability of GO annotations on proteins belonging to the Embryophyta group from a set of features extracted solely from their primary amino acid sequence.

TI - Two-dimensional wavelet transform feature extraction for porous silicon chemical sensors
AB - Designing reliable, fast responding, highly sensitive, and low-power consuming chemo-sensory systems has long been a major goal in chemo-sensing. This goal, however, presents a difficult challenge because having a set of chemo-sensory detectors exhibiting all these aforementioned ideal conditions are still largely un-realizable to-date. This paper presents a unique perspective on capturing more in-depth insights into the physicochemical interactions of two distinct, selectively chemically modified porous silicon (pSi) film-based optical gas sensors by implementing an innovative, based on signal processing methodology, namely the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform. Specifically, the method consists of using the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform as a feature extraction method to capture the non-stationary behavior from the bi-dimensional pSi rugate sensor response. Utilizing a comprehensive set of measurements collected from each of the aforementioned optically based chemical sensors, we evaluate the significance of our approach on a complex, six-dimensional chemical analyte discrimination/quantification task problem. Due to the bi-dimensional aspects naturally governing the optical sensor response to chemical analytes, our findings provide evidence that the proposed feature extractor strategy may be a valuable tool to deepen our understanding of the performance of optically based chemical sensors as well as an important step toward attaining their implementation in more realistic chemo-sensing applications.

TI - On the performance of gas sensor arrays in open sampling systems using Inhibitory Support Vector Machines
AB - Chemo-resistive transduction presents practical advantages for capturing the spatio-temporal and structural organization of chemical compounds dispersed in different human habitats. In an open sampling system, however, where the chemo-sensory elements are directly exposed to the environment being monitored, the identification and monitoring of chemical substances present a more difficult challenge due to the dispersion mechanisms of gaseous chemical analytes, namely diffusion, turbulence, and advection. The success of such actively changeable practice is influenced by the adequate implementation of algorithmically driven formalisms combined with the appropriate design of experimental protocols. On the basis of this functional joint-formulation, in this study we examine an innovative methodology based on the inhibitory processing mechanisms encountered in the structural assembly of the insect's brain, namely Inhibitory Support Vector Machine (ISVM) applied to training a sensor array platform and evaluate its capabilities relevant to odor detection and identification under complex environmental conditions. We generated - and made publicly available - an extensive and unique dataset with a chemical detection platform consisting of 72 conductometric metal-oxide based chemical sensors in a custom-designed wind tunnel test-bed facility to test our methodology. Our findings suggest that the aforementioned methodology can be a valuable tool to guide the decision of choosing the training conditions for a cost-efficient system calibration as well as an important step toward the understanding of the degradation level of the sensory system when the environmental conditions change.

TI - SVM-based feature selection to optimize sensitivity-specificity balance applied to weaning
AB - Classification algorithms with unbalanced datasets tend to produce high predictive accuracy over the
majority class, but poor predictive accuracy over the minority class. This problem is very common in
biomedical datamining. This paper introduces a Support Vector Machine (SVM)- based optimized
feature selection method, to select the most relevant features and maintain an accurate and well-
balanced sensitivity-specificity result between unbalanced groups. A new metric called the balance 
index (B) is defined to implement this optimization. The balance index measures the difference 
between the misclassified data within each class. The proposed optimized feature selection is applied to the classification of patients' weaning trials from mechanical ventilation: patients with successful trials
who were able to maintain spontaneous breathing after 48h and patients who failed to maintain
spontaneous breathing and were reconnected to mechanical ventilation after 30min.

cardiac interbeat and breath durations. First, the most suitable parameters (C th ,C ,s)are selected to define the appropriate SVM. Then, the features election process is carried out with this SVM, to
maintain B lower than 40%. The best result is obtained using 6 features with an accuracy of 80%, a B of 18.64%, a sensitivity of 74.36% and a specificity of 82.42%.

TI - Ischemic risk stratification by means of multivariate analysis of the heart rate variability
AB - In this work, a univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of indexes derived from heart rate variability (HRV) was conducted to stratify patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) in cardiac risk groups. Indexes conditional entropy, refined multiscale entropy (RMSE), detrended fluctuation analysis, time and frequency analysis, were applied to the RR interval series (beat-to-beat series), for single and multiscale complexity analysis of the HRV in IDC patients. Also, clinical parameters were considered. Two different end-points after a follow-up of three years were considered: (i) analysis A, with 151 survivor patients as a low risk group and 13 patients that suffered sudden cardiac death as a high risk group; (ii) analysis B, with 192 survivor patients as a low risk group and 30 patients that suffered cardiac mortality as a high risk group. A univariate and multivariate linear discriminant analysis was used as a statistical technique for classifying patients in risk groups. Sensitivity (Sen) and specificity (Spe) were calculated as diagnostic criteria in order to evaluate the performance of the indexes and their linear combinations. Sen and Spe values of 80.0% and 72.9%, respectively, were obtained during daytime by combining one clinical parameter and one index from RMSE, and during nighttime Sen = 80% and Spe = 73.4% were attained by combining one clinical factor and two indexes from RMSE. In particular, relatively long time scales were more relevant for classifying patients into risk groups during nighttime, while during daytime shorter scales performed better. The results suggest that the left atrial size, indexed to body surface and RMSE indexes are those that allow enhanced classification of ischemic patients in their respective risk groups, confirming that a single measurement is not enough to fully characterize ischemic risk patients and the clinical relevance of HRV complexity measures.

TI - Resource and performance trade-offs in real-time embedded control systems
AB - Embedded control systems are subject to conflicting demands: end-users ask for devices with better capabilities while strong industrial competition impose tight cost constrains that results in devices with limited resources. Current research in the multidisciplinary embedded systems discipline indicates that by combining realtime and control systems it is theoretically feasible to design resource-constrained embedded control systems capable of trading-off control performance and resource usage. This paper focuses on the implementation feasibility of recent state-of-the-art resource/performance-aware (RPA) policies that can be applied to a set of control loops that concurrently execute on a microprocessor. The objective of these policies is to improve control performance and/or to minimize resource utilization. The paper first reviews existing state-of-the-art RPA policies. Then it presents a performance evaluation framework (PEF) that permits to assess whether RPA policies can be implemented in practice. The PEF is designed using a modular approach and following the guidelines obtained by a taxonomic analysis performed on the state-of-the-art RPA policies. Finally, a case study is presented where the PEF is applied to a set of representative RPA policies. The case study reveals that the modularity of the PEF allows tailoring the framework to evaluate any specific RPA policy, which indicates that RPA policies can be implemented in practice. But it also reveals that the problem of assessing diverse RPA policies in fair conditions implies facing and solving conflicting demands by even taking decisions that may not favor equal all policies under evaluation. Nevertheless, the comparative analysis permits identifying potential benefits and drawbacks of each policy, as well as extracting design guidelines for future real-time embedded control systems theory and practice.

TI - Segmented Symbolic Dynamics for Risk Stratification in Patients with Ischemic Heart Failure, Cardiovascular Engineering and Technology
AB - Chronic heart failure (CHF) is recognized as
major and escalating public health problem. Approximately
69% of CHF patients suffer from cardiac death within
5 years after the initial diagnosis. Until now, no generally
accepted ECG risk predictors in CHF patients are available.
The objective of this study was to investigate the suitability of
the new developed non-linear method segmented symbolic
dynamics (SSD) for risk stratification in patients with
ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) in comparison to other
indices from time and frequency domain, non-linear dynamics,
and clinical markers. Twenty-four hour Holter ECGs
were recorded from 256 ICM patients. Heart rate variability
(HRV) was analyzed from the filtered beat-to-beat interval
time series. For calculating SSD, NN interval time series
were segmented in 1 min overlapping windows with a
window length of 30 min. For each window a symbol- and
word-transformation was performed and probabilities of
word type occurrences were calculated. Several indices from
frequency domain and non-linear dynamics revealed high
univariate significant differences (p<0.01) discriminating
low (n = 221) and high risk ICM patients (n = 35). For
multivariate risk stratification in ICM patients the two
optimal mixed parameter sets consisting of either two clinical
and three non-clinical indices (two from SSD) or three
clinical and two non-clinical indices (one from SSD) achieved
74 and 75% sensitivity and 79 and 76% specificity, respectively.
These results suggest that the new SSD enhances
considerably risk stratification in ICM patients. The multivariate
analysis including SSD leads to an optimum accuracy
of 81%.

TI - Correntropy-based spectral characterization of respiratory Patterns in patients with chronic heart failure
AB - A correntropy-based technique is proposed for the characterization and classification of respiratory flow signals in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with periodic or nonperiodic breathing (PB or nPB, respectively) and healthy subjects. The correntropy is a recently introduced, generalized correlation measure whose properties lend themselves to the definition of a correntropybased spectral density (CSD). Using this technique, both respiratory
and modulation frequencies can be reliably detected at their original positions in the spectrum without prior demodulation of
the flow signal. Single-parameter classification of respiratory patterns
is investigated for three different parameters extracted from the respiratory and modulation frequency bands of the CSD, and one parameter defined by the correntropy mean. The results show that the ratio between the powers in the modulation and respiratory frequency bands provides the best result when classifying CHF patients with either PBor nPB, yielding an accuracy of 88.9%.
The correntropy mean offers excellent performance when classifying CHF patients versus healthy subjects, yielding an accuracy of 95.2% and discriminating nPB patients fromhealthy subjects with an accuracy of 94.4%.

TI - Breathing pattern characterization in chronic heart failure patients using the respiratory flow signal
AB - This study proposes a method for the characterization of respiratory patterns in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients with periodic breathing (PB) and nonperiodic
breathing (nPB), using the flow signal. Autoregressive modeling of the envelope of the respiratory flow signal is the starting point for the pattern characterization. Spectral parameters extracted from the discriminant frequency band (DB) are used to characterize the respiratory patterns. For
each classification problem, the most discriminant parameter subset is selected using the leave-one-out cross-validation
technique. The power in the right DB provides an accuracy of 84.6% when classifying PB vs. nPB patterns in CHF
patients, whereas the power of the DB provides an accuracy of 85.5% when classifying the whole group of CHF patients
vs. healthy subjects, and 85.2% when classifying nPB patients vs. healthy subjects.

TI - Simulation study of a remote wireless path tracking control with delay estimation for an autonomous guided vehicle
AB - Industrial applications involving mobile systems can benefit from the use of wireless technology. However, wireless communication has not been widely accepted on the factory floor due to its difficulty in achieving the timely and reliable transmission of messages
over error-prone wireless channels. This paper presents an autonomous guided vehicle (AGV) path tracking wireless control system where an accurate delay estimation scheme is shown to be the key for successful operation. The control architecture consists
on an AGV connected through a wireless network to a controller. To mitigate the negative effects that varying time delays in data transfer have in the networked control
loop, the controller performs two tasks at each loop operation. First, it uses a Kalman filter to produce an optimal delay estimate considering a simple stochastic model of the wireless delay dynamics. Second, each delay estimate is employed to infer the real AGV position which permits to compute the appropriate control commands. Results show that the proposed technique provides more efficient and effective operation for path
tracking control compared to similar previously proposed solutions.

TI - An invasive and a noninvasive approach for the automatic differentiation of obstructive and central hypopneas
AB - The automatic differentiation of obstructive and central
respiratory events is a major challenge in the diagnosis of
sleep-disordered breathing. Esophageal pressure (Pes) measurement
is the gold-standard method to identify these events. This
study presents a new classifier that automatically differentiates
obstructive and central hypopneas with the Pes signal and a new
approach for an automatic noninvasive classifierwith nasal airflow.
An overall of 28 patients underwent night polysomnography with
Pes recording, and a total of 769 hypopneas were manually scored
by human experts to create a gold-standard annotation set. Features
were automatically extracted fromthe Pes signal to train and
test the classifiers (discriminant analysis, support vector machines,
and adaboost). After a significantly (p < 0.01) higher incidence of
inspiratory flow limitation episodes in obstructive hypopneas was
objectively, invasively assessed compared to central hypopneas, the
feasibility of an automatic noninvasive classifier with features extracted
from the airflow signal was demonstrated. The automatic
invasive classifier achieved a mean sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy
of 0.90 after a 100-fold cross validation. The automatic noninvasive
feasibility study obtained similar hypopnea differentiation
results as a manual noninvasive classification algorithm. Hence,
both systems seem promising for the automatic differentiation of
obstructive and central hypopneas.

TI - Computational detection of transcription factor binding sites through differential R'enyi entropy
AB - Regulatory sequence detection is a critical facet for understanding the cell mechanisms in order to coordinate the response to stimuli. Protein synthesis involves the binding of a
transcription factor to specific sequences in a process related to the gene expression initiation. A characteristic of this binding process is that the same factor binds with different sequences placed along all genome. Thus, any computational approach shows many difficulties related with this variability observed from the binding sequences. This paper proposes the detection of transcription factor binding sites based on a parametric uncertainty measurement (R'enyi entropy). This detection algorithm evaluates the variation on the total R'enyi entropy of a set of sequences when a candidate sequence is assumed to be a true binding site belonging to the set. The efficiency of the method is measured in form of Receiver Operating Characteristic curves on different transcription factors from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae organism. The results are compared with other known motif
detection algorithms such as Motif Discovery scan (MDscan) and Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME)

TI - Symbolic dynamic analysis of relations between cardiac and breathing cycles in patients on weaning trials
AB - Traditional time-domain techniques of data analysis are often not sufficient to characterize the complex dynamics of the cardiorespiratory interdependencies during
the weaning trials. In this paper, the interactions between the heart rate (HR) and the breathing rate (BR) were studied
using joint symbolic dynamic analysis. A total of 133 patients on weaning trials from mechanical ventilation were analyzed:
94 patients with successful weaning (group S) and 39 patients that failed to maintain spontaneous breathing (group F). The word distribution matrix enabled a coarse-grained quantitative assessment of short-term nonlinear analysis of the cardiorespiratory interactions. The histogram of the occurrence probability of the cardiorespiratory words presented a
higher homogeneity in group F than in group S, measured with a higher number of forbidden words in group S as well as a higher number of words whose probability of occurrence is higher than a probability threshold in group S. The discriminant analysis revealed the best results when applying symbolic dynamic variables. Therefore, we hypothesize that joint symbolic dynamic analysis provides enhanced information about different interactions between HR and BR, when comparing patients with successful weaning and patients that failed to maintain spontaneous breathing in the weaning procedure.

TI - A new gene-based association test for genome-wide association studies
AB - Genome-wide association studies are widely used today to discover genetic factors that modify the risk of complex diseases. Usually, these methods work in a SNP-by-SNP fashion. We present a gene-based test that can be applied in the context of genome-wide association studies. We compare both strategies, SNP-based and gene-based, in a sample of cases and controls for rheumatoid arthritis. We obtained different results using each strategy. The SNP-based test found the PTPN22 gene while the gene-based test found the PHF19-TRAF1-C5 region. That suggests that no single strategy performs better than another in all cases and that a certain underlying genetic architecture can be delineated more easily with one strategy rather than with another.

TI - Dimensionality reduction oriented toward the feature visualization for ischemia detection
AB - An effective data representation methodology on high-dimension feature spaces is presented, which allows a better interpretation of subjacent physiological phenomena (namely, cardiac behavior related to cardiovascular diseases), and is based
on search criteria over a feature set resulting in an increase in the detection capability of ischemic pathologies, but also connecting these features with the physiologic representation of the ECG.
The proposed dimension reduction scheme consists of three levels: projection, interpretation, and visualization. First, a hybrid algorithm is described that projects the multidimensional data to a lower dimension space, gathering the features that contribute similarly in the meaning of the covariance reconstruction in order to find information of clinical relevance over the initial training space. Next, an algorithm of variable selection is provided that
further reduces the dimension, taking into account only the variables that offer greater class separability, and finally, the selected feature set is projected to a 2-D space in order to verify the performance
of the suggested dimension reduction algorithm in terms of the discrimination capability for ischemia detection. The ECG
recordings used in this study are fromthe European ST-T database and from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia database. In both cases, over 99% feature reduction was obtained, and classification precision was over 99% using a five-nearest-neighbor classifier (5-NN).

TI - An intelligent detector based on temperature modulation of a gas sensor with a digital signal processor
AB - An intelligent detector based on a hot-plate gas sensor and a digital signal processor (DSP) is presented. The work comprises sensor measurements and gas identification with a pattern recognition (PARC) system along with a systematic verification of both stages, thanks to clustering validity methods and performance tests. Commercial silicon micromachined tin-oxide sensors have been used to capture dynamic measurements modulating the sensor heater at different temperatures, waveforms and frequencies. Feature extraction is based on the spectral and transient analysis of the sensor output signals. The PARC systems are based on self-organizing maps (SOM) and recent variations of these well-known neural networks. The proposed hardware is in charge of the whole system: the sensor temperature modulation and signal processing.

TI - Analysis of tracheal sounds during forced exhalation in asthma patients and normal subjects : bronchodilator response effect
AB - Purpose: During the past 10 years, the acoustic analysis of breath sounds has been used as a diagnostic tool in patients suffering from obstructive respiratory diseases. Acoustic analysis might be able to monitor the response to bronchodilator therapy in a clinical setting. So far, few studies have been carried out in asthmatic patients. To assess the responses of a sampling of asthma patients to an inhaled bronchodilator (terbutaline) by means of spectral analysis of the tracheal sound performed during forced expiratory maneuvers.

Material and methods: Seventeen nonsmoking asthma patients (9 were male, 8 were female) who had been suffering from the disease for greater than or equal to 15 years were included in the study, as were 15 normal subjects (7 were male, 8 were female). The average age (+/- SD) was 56.5 +/- 15.2 years (FVC, 2.7 +/- 0.9 L [63.4%]; FEV1, 1.5 +/- 0.6 L [53.0%]). The tracheal sounds were collected during three forced expiratory maneuvers with a sampling frequency of 5,000 Hz and were analyzed by applying a 16-parameter autoregressive model.

Results: The centroid frequency decreased after the bronchodilator was given at different flow segments between 1.2 and 0.4 L/s, with significant changes between 0.6 and 0.4 L/s,

Conclusions: Patients with asthma showed changes in the spectral acoustic analysis frequencies after the administration of a bronchodilator drug (terbutaline) during forced expiratory maneuvers.
