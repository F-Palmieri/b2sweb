**Research Focus**

Our research encompasses a broad spectrum of areas, including:

-   **Biomedical Engineering:** Developing novel solutions to complex medical challenges.

-   **Bioinformatics:** Analyzing and interpreting biological data to uncover new insights.

-   **Machine Learning and Statistics:** Applying advanced computational techniques to model and predict biological phenomena.

**Key Projects and Tools**

We are proud to have developed several impactful tools and projects:

-   **FELLA:** An R package designed for the enrichment and interpretation of metabolomics data, facilitating the identification of affected pathways and biological functions. ([FELLA](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FELLA.html))

-   **diffuStats:** An R package that computes and benchmarks diffusion scores on biological networks, aiding in the analysis of molecular interactions. ([diffustats](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/diffuStats.html)

-   **Share4Rare:** A data science initiative aimed at supporting patients with rare diseases through collaborative research and information sharing. ([share4rare](https://share4rare.org))

**Collaborations and Community Engagement**

We actively collaborate with various research networks and institutions to foster innovation and share knowledge. Our leadership in the coordination of projects like Xartec Salut underscores our commitment to advancing health technologies and contributing to the scientific community.
