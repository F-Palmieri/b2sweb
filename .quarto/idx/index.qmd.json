Leveraging data from over 200,000 diabetic individuals in the SIDIAP primary healthcare database, which includes diagnostic codes, medication records, and various clinical measurements, DARE underwent an unsupervised pre-training phase followed by fine-tuning for three specific clinical prediction tasks:\n\nPredicting the occurrence of comorbidities. Assessing the achievement of target glycemic control (defined as glycated hemoglobin \\< 7%). Forecasting changes in glucose-lowering treatments. In cross-validation, DARE demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline models, achieving area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 for comorbidity prediction, 0.91 for treatment prediction, and 0.82 for HbA1c target prediction. These findings suggest that attention-based encoders like DARE can effectively model complex relationships in longitudinal T2DM data, potentially aiding clinicians in personalized disease management strategies.\n\n::::: grid\n::: {.g-col-lg-6 .g-col-12 style=\"max-height: 605px;\"}\n![](images/embedding.png){.hello-output fig-alt=\"Visual inspection of the output space of DARE: each point represents embeddings for 5000 random patients, with colors indicating their drug groups.\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-lg-6 .g-col-12 style=\"background-color: white; border: 1px solid #dee2e6; height: max-605px;\"}\n![](images/embeddingdrugs.png){fig-alt=\"Visual inspection of the output space of DARE: each point represents embeddings for 5000 random patients, with colors indicating their comorbidities.\"}\n:::\n:::::\n::::::\n\n:::::: {#bioinfo .tab-pane .fade role=\"tabpanel\" aria-labelledby=\"bioinfo-tab\"}\n::::: grid\n::: {.g-col-lg-6 .g-col-12 style=\"max-height: 605px;\"}\nThe study titled \"mWISE: An Algorithm for Context-Based Annotation of Liquid Chromatography‚ÄìMass Spectrometry Features through Diffusion in Graphs\" introduces mWISE, an R package designed to enhance the annotation of LC‚ÄìMS data in untargeted metabolomics.
