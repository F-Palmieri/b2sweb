My name is Alexandre Perera Lluna, sometimes Alex Perera. I hold a degree in Physics, a second degree in Electrical Engineering, and a PhD in Physics from the University of Barcelona. I currently lead the [B2SLab](https://b2slab.upc.edu/), which is part of the Institut de Recerca i Innovació en Salut ([IRIS](https://iris.upc.edu/)), formerly the Research Center for Biomedical Engineering (CREB) at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Polytechnic University of Catalonia, UPC), located in the beautiful city of Barcelona. It is a fantastic place for research, culture, and leisure—I truly love this city.\n\nAt B2SLab, we integrate Data Science, Bioinformatics, and Bioengineering. My main interests include predicting disease trajectories using Transformer and Linear models, as well as applying machine learning to Rare Diseases. I also have experience in data integration, data fusion, metabolomics, functional enrichment, and bioengineering. Since 2022, I have been a full professor at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya.\n\n-   In 2019, I was appointed as the head of the Research Center for Biomedical Engineering at UPC (CREB-UPC, Centre de Recerca en Enginyeria Biomèdica).\n-   I also coordinate a [fascinating project named Xartec Salut](https://xartecsalut.com).\n\n## Social Networks\n\n-   Find me on my profile on\n    -   <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://social.iris.upc.edu/@alexperera\">Mastodon</a>\n    -   <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alexperera.social.iris.upc.edu.ap.brid.gy\">Blue Sky</a>\n-   No, we do not use X nor twitter, and we will not use it for the time being\n\n## Teaching\n\nI teach several subjects, including:\n\n-   Introduction to Bioinformatics.\n-   Data Mining for Biomedical Databases.\n-   Scientific computing.\n-   Machine learning.\n-   Embedded and real time computing.\n\n## Ongoing PhD Thesis\n\n-   [**Maria Barranco**](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/maria-barranco-altarriba/ \"Maria Barranco\")[^1]\n-   [Enrico Manzini](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/enrico-manzini/)\n-   [Joshua Llano](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/joshua-llano)\n-   [Joana Gelabert](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/joana-gelabert-xirinachs)\n-   [Blanca Aleajos](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/blanca-aleajos)\n-   [Helena Rodriguez Gonzalez](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/helena-rodriguez-gonzalez/)\n-   Pol Solà\n-   Pol Canal\n-   Pol Ezquerra\n-   [Aitor Moruno](https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/aitor-moruno-cuenca)\n\n[^1]: soon to defend her thesis\n\n## Former PhD Thesis\n\nI have proudly advised several PhD students who have successfully defended their dissertations:\n\n-   Helena Brunel. *Genetic association analysis of complex diseases through information theoretic metrics and linear pleiotropy*.
