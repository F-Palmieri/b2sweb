She did her PhD at the B2SLab between 2017-2021, focusing on ways to ensure the quality and reliability of deep learning models used to predict how proteins and compounds interact in the early stages of drug discovery. During her PhD, she collaborated with the start-up Mind the Byte and did a research stay at Uniprot, in the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL) in Cambridge, UK. Since 2020, sheâ€™s been working as a Data Scientist at the pharma company Boehringer Ingelheim, first in R&D in Biberach (Germany) and now back in Barcelona, in the Business Operations department.</p><a href=\"https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/angela-lopez-delrio/\" target=\"_blank\">https://b2slab.upc.edu/team/angela-lopez-delrio/</a></div></div><div style=\"display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-bottom: 20px; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px;\"><div style=\"flex: 1; max-width: 150px;\"><img src=\"staff_images/staff_Sergi_Picart_Armada.jpg\" alt=\"Sergi Picart Armada\" style=\"width: 100%; border-radius: 10px;\"></div><div style=\"flex: 3; margin-left: 20px;\"><h3 style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Sergi Picart Armada</h3><p style=\"margin: 5px 0;\">Welcome to my small site! My name is Sergi Picart and my background is Industrial Engineering and a Degree in Mathematics. I deeply thank CFIS (UPC, Barcelona, Spain) for offering me this excellent opportunity.\nI used to be a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering, advised by Alexandre Perera in the B2SLab. The defense took place virtually in Covid19 times and can be found here. You will find further information about the publications and the software in the sections below.\nI enjoy playing with math, statistical learning and programming. Likewise, computational biology is an amusing and rewarding field to explore. My main research topic included interpretable diffusion algorithms on biological networks, combined with functional analysis on metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics studies.</p><a href=\"http://b2slab.upc.edu/team/sergi-picart/\" target=\"_blank\">http://b2slab.upc.edu/team/sergi-picart/</a></div></div>\n\n## former students working in a Master thesis or degree thesis at b2slab\n\n\n",
