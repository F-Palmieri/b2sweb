The defense took place virtually in Covid19 times and can be found here. You will find further information about the publications and the software in the sections below. I enjoy playing with math, statistical learning and programming. Likewise, computational biology is an amusing and rewarding field to explore. My main research topic included interpretable diffusion algorithms on biological networks, combined with functional analysis on metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics studies.\n\nhttp://b2slab.upc.edu/team/sergi-picart/,",

It is based on the expertise of the coordinator managing a previous project: Rare Commons (RC). This is a platform that currently includes 9 different diseases. RC has demonstrated that the collective intelligence coming from parents of children with rare diseases is needed to increase the current knowledge available. A broad sample from the patient community has been identified, in several cases with a higher number of patients compared with previous initiatives.\nS4R is proposing dealing with two important challenges that will improve the previous experience with the RC project: to increase the power of the users of the platform, developing a platform based on a bottom-up model with a patient-centered design, and to promote synergy by grouping diseases that share common features, instead of individual diseases.\nSeven European institutions or associations participate in this project under the coordination of Sant Joan de Déu Foundation. The Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya is one of these partners through B2SLab’s participation.\nThe voice of the patients is at the heart of the project. Two relevant patient organizations are part of the consortium: The World Duchenne Organization (UPPMD) and the Melanoma Patient Network Europe (MPNE). Other members of the consortium are focused on other important areas of expertise: technology developers (Omada Interactiva), biostatistics (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya), social innovation (The Synergist), clinical background in neuromuscular disorders (Newcastle University) and socioeconomic impact (Asserta).\nThe launch meeting of the project was held in Barcelona on the 11th and 12th of January. During the next year, centered on the development of the platform, several activities are scheduled to ensure that the voice of the patient is included from the outset. The platform will be accessible for the users at the beginning of 2019 and is going to be piloted with two specific groups of diseases: neuromuscular disorders and paediatric rare tumors."

Those find application in ubiquitous computational biology applications, being one representative example the propagation of genetic information (e.g. disease-associated genes) in a gene-gene or a protein-protein interaction network. A distinctive feature of diffuStats is the implementation of statistically normalised scores, which address the recurrent question of how would the propagation of a randomised input look. It offers parametric, exact z-scores as well as permutation-based empirical probabilities.\nThe diffuStats software was published in:\n\nPicart-Armada, S., Thompson, W. K., Buil, A., & Perera-Lluna, A. (2018). diffuStats: an R package to compute diffusion-based scores on biological networks. Bioinformatics, 34(3), 533-534.\n\nGeneral guidelines on how to choose the scores, along with mathematical properties of the normalised and unnormalised scores, were published in:\n\nPicart-Armada, S., Thompson, W. K., Buil, A., & Perera-Lluna, A. (2020). The effect of statistical normalisation on network propagation scores. Bioinformatics, btaa896.\n\nFrom versions 1.10.2/1.11.2 onwards, diffuStats provides functions to export the exact statistical moments (means and variances), see ?moments. Now the users can characterise the systematic biases in the diffusion scores in their domain of application.",

Although there exist several variants of this method, multiview MDS method proposed here follows the structure of the “classical” MDS. The overall structure of the algorithm is as follows, where k is the desired dimensionality of the output space:\n\nCompute the distance matrices of the input matrices (when necessary).\nDouble-center (by rows and columns) the distance matrices.\nCompute the common eigenvectors of the previous matrices. Return the k eigenvectors with highest eigenvalues as the output space.\n\nThe common eigenvectors are computed using an algorithm derived from the algorithm proposed in (Trendafilov 2010).\n\nUsage\nThe mvmds function that implements the multiview multidimensional scaling method offers a simple interface, very similar to the single-view counterpart function cmdscale. First, instead of a single matrix of data to project, it requires a list of matrices. A list of matrices is used instead of a 3D matrix because the input matrices can have different number of columns. Moreover some or all of the input views may be dist objects. The other parameter is the desired number of dimensions of the output space, which defaults to 2.\nThe following example uses the handwritten digits dataset1, that contains 2,000 handwritten digits from 0 to 9. There are 200 digits of each value, hence the definition of the vector of sample classes.\nSix different feature sets are extracted from the digits images and provided in the dataset. From these, the next example uses four: the original pixels, the Fourier coefficients, the profile correlations and 6 morphological features. Then, mvmds is applied to these four data views in order to obtain a consistent low-dimensional representation of the digits that can be plotted.\n\nlibrary(multiview)\nfourier  &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-fou.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\nprofcorr &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-fac.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\npixels   &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-pix.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\nmorpho   &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-mor.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\n\nclasses &lt;- as.vector(sapply(0:9, function(x) rep(x,200)))\n\nprojection &lt;- mvmds(list(fourier, profcorr, pixels, morpho), k=2)\n\nmypalette &lt;- c(\"chartreuse\", \"blueviolet\", \"deeppink1\", \"cyan2\", \"black\", \"blue3\", \n              \"gold1\", \"seagreen1\", \"gray60\", \"red\")\nplot(projection[,1:2], col = mypalette[classes+1], \n    pch = as.character(classes), axes = FALSE,  xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the example shows, mvmds simply requires the input views in a list as the first parameter and the desired dimensionality of the output space.

Multiview t-SNE is a multiview extension of t-SNE that generates a single low-dimensional representation of several input views. Like the original t-SNE method, multiview t-SNE is a method designed to generate embeddings of low dimensionality, typically 2 or 3, for example for data visualization.\nGiven a dataset with n data samples and v data views, the overall steps of this method are:\n\nFor each input data view, compute a n x n probability matrix. The ij value in these matrices are computed based on the distance from point i to point j, according to a Gaussian probability distribution.\nCombine the previous probability matrices into a single probability matrix P using expert opinion pooling theory, more specifically the log-linear formulation described in (Abbas 2009) and the weight assignment proposed in (Carvalho and Larson 2012).\nRandomly generate an initial projection of the data points.\nUse gradient descent optimization to adjust the neighbourhood probability matrix of the data projection to the probability matrix P.\n\n\nUsage\nThe mvtsne function of this package accepts, in its simplest form, two parameters: a list of input views and the number of dimensions of the desired output space. The input views can be either feature matrices or dist objects (or a mix of both). In any case, the number of samples in all input views has to be the same, although the number of features can be different. mvtsne returns the low-dimensional embedding as well as the weight assigned to each input view.\nA basic usage example, with the same handwritten digits dataset described above, is presented next:\n\nlibrary(multiview)\nfourier  &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-fou.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\nprofcorr &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-fac.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\npixels   &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-pix.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\nmorpho   &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-mor.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\n\nclasses &lt;- as.vector(sapply(0:9, function(x) rep(x,200)))\n\nprojection &lt;- mvtsne(list(fourier, profcorr, pixels, morpho), k=2)\n\nmypalette &lt;- c(\"chartreuse\", \"blueviolet\", \"deeppink1\", \"cyan2\", \"black\", \"blue3\", \n              \"gold1\", \"seagreen1\", \"gray60\", \"red\")\n\nplot(projection$embedding, col = mypalette[classes+1], \n    pch = as.character(classes), axes = FALSE,  xlab=\"\", ylab=\"\")\n\nThe remaining parameters of mvtsne allow a fine adjustment of the method and they are equivalent to those in tsne::tsne.",

    "text": "Multiview spectral clustering\nSpectral clustering (Shi and Malik 2005), (Ng, Jordan, and Weiss 2001) is a well known clustering method whose distinctive feature is that it is capable of finding non-convex clusters, as it produces partitions of connected points. This is remarkably different from most classical clustering methods like k-means, that cluster points by distance, regardless of the topology and cohesion of the groups.\nPackage multiview includes a multiview spectral clustering method, available through function mvsc. A summarized description of the method follows:\n\nA Gaussian radial basis function is applied to the input samples for each input matrix. This produces a n x n matrix for each input view.\nThe symmetrical Laplacian matrix of the previous matrices is computed.\nUsing (Trendafilov 2010), the k first common eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrices are computed. This produces an n x k matrix that represents a clustering-oriented projection of the input data.\nK-means (a robust configuration) is applied to the previous matrix and the resulting clustering assignment is returned.\n\n\nUsage\nFunction mvsc first parameter is a list of input views, which can be either standard matrices (interpreted as sample/feature matrices) or dist objects, or a mix of both. All input views must be complete, i.e. they must have the same number of samples. The other mandatory parameter is k, an integer that controls the number of clusters produced. An example using the handwritten digits dataset described above follows:\n\nlibrary(multiview)\nfourier  &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-fou.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\nprofcorr &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-fac.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\npixels   &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-pix.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\nmorpho   &lt;- read.table(\"digits_data/mfeat-mor.txt\", header=FALSE, sep=\"\")\n\nclasses &lt;- as.vector(sapply(0:9, function(x) rep(x,200)))\n\nclust   &lt;- mvsc(list(fourier, profcorr, pixels, morpho), k=10)\n\n# $clustering member has the clustering assignment vector\nknitr::kable(table(classes, clust$clustering))\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n181\n18\n0\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n4\n2\n3\n0\n1\n1\n189\n\n\n2\n1\n195\n1\n3\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n0\n4\n178\n0\n0\n5\n0\n0\n10\n3\n\n\n4\n2\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n195\n2\n\n\n5\n186\n1\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5\n0\n\n\n6\n2\n0\n0\n0\n188\n1\n0\n7\n0\n2\n\n\n7\n0\n5\n0\n38\n0\n154\n0\n0\n1\n2\n\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n4\n190\n0\n6\n\n\n9\n3\n0\n1\n182\n0\n3\n0\n6\n1\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the numbers assigned to each cluster are arbitrary, that is why they do not match with the original class labels. However, given the different numbering, the previous example shows the coincidence between the data classes and the clusters found.\nmvsc provides two parameters to fine-tune the clustering produced. First, parameter sigmas allows to specify the \\(\\sigma\\) parameter of the Gaussian radial basis function applied to the input views. This parameter can either be a vector of real values, with the \\(\\sigma\\) to use on each input view, or a single real value, meaning the same \\(\\sigma\\) will be used on all views.\nHowever, it can be difficult to estimate a proper value for \\(\\sigma\\). Therefore, a more intuitive parameter is provided, neighbours, which ultimately controls the \\(\\sigma\\) values used. This parameter usually is a single integer number specifying the average number of neighbours estimated for each data sample. Higher values cause more compact data projections, while lower values produce spread away projections. The practical consequences for clustering vary. Using too high values may end up merging different clusters, while using too low values may produce isolated islands of points, disconnected from their main cluster. Parameter neighbours can also be a vector of integers, where each value is respectively used on each input view. In general this option is not recommended, as the intrinsic structure of the data should be the same across the different views and a single neighbours value should suit all the input views.\nFollowing the previous example, neighbours adjustment can be used to improve the results:\n\nclust   &lt;- mvsc(list(fourier, profcorr, pixels, morpho), k=10, neighbours=2)\n\n# $clustering member has the clustering assignment vector\nknitr::kable(table(classes, clust$clustering))\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n190\n10\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n6\n192\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\n2\n0\n2\n1\n0\n197\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n0\n1\n3\n8\n3\n2\n181\n0\n0\n2\n\n\n4\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n6\n0\n0\n0\n192\n\n\n5\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n191\n5\n0\n0\n3\n\n\n6\n183\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n0\n14\n1\n\n\n7\n0\n25\n170\n1\n4\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n8\n0\n0\n0\n7\n0\n0\n0\n2\n191\n0\n\n\n9\n0\n183\n0\n5\n0\n7\n0\n0\n4\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the latter table shows, there is a better coincidence between each class and each cluster obtained. This parameter is ignored if sigmas is different from NULL.\nIf neither sigmas nor neighbours are given, then mvsc estimates the \\(\\sigma\\) of each input view using the heuristic proposed in (Planck and Luxburg 2006), i.e. as the average distance to the \\(\\log n\\)-th neighbour.\nFinally, parameter clustering allows the user to omit the final clustering phase (step 4 of the algorithm), and making mvsc return only the data projection computed.",

However, if the adductTable parameter is set to ”negAdducts”, the default MAIT table for negative fragments will be chosen instead. peakAnnotation function also creates an output table (see Table 3) containing the peak mass (in charge/mass units), the retention time (in minutes) and the spectral ID number for all the peaks detected. A call of the function peakAnnotation may be:\n\nMAIT &lt;- peakAnnotation(MAIT.object = MAIT, corrWithSamp = 0.7, corrBetSamp = 0.75, perfwhm = 0.6)\n\nBecause the parameter adductTable was not set in the peakAnnotation call, a warning was shown informing that the default MAIT table for positive polarisation mode was selected.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Does Physical Activity Impact On The Intellectual Performance Of Students?\n\n\n\nThe performance experienced by medicine in recent years could not be explained without the role of new technologies. Specifically, medical technologies have played an important role in understanding the mechanisms involved in the biological behaviour of the human body. Research, development and technological innovation become vital tools not only to improve the diagnosis and therapy of diseases, but also for improving the quality of life. Keep reading to learn B2SLab latest activities in physical activity research. In recent years, the hypothesis is debated whether physical activity stimulates intellectual performance of students. This hypothesis considers that exercise changes the neuronal communication by acting on the space of exchanging information, which affects the brain connectivity by modifying the structure and function of the nervous system. Researchers of the Biomedical Engineering Research Center CREB (Technical University of Catalonia UPC) want to bring our knowledge to the discussion of the previous hypothesis together with members of the Alliance for Biomedical Research and Technology (BERTA). This Alliance is formed by the Sant Joan de Déu Hospital, the CREB, the IBUB (Institute of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona) and the IR3C (Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behavior, University of Barcelona). The BERTA Alliance aims to develop projects where the child is the star. Within the field of health, the most important market is the adult, which focuses almost all innovations in the health sector. The pediatric sector requires customized solutions because they often cannot incorporate proposals conceived and designed for adults. We have initiated a project to assess the influence of physical exercise on intellectual performance of children. Specifically, the objectives of this project are: – To determine biomarkers of synaptic function, and to assess cognitive functions before, during and after physical activity, using electrophysiological testing. – To assess the kinetics of neuronal growth factors produced by exercise. – To analyse individual genetic variations that predispose to a greater cognitive benefit of exercise. – To study brain changes by neuroimaging analysis. The CREB provides to the project its knowledge on applied research, proposing new medical technology tools for the monitoring of physiological variables and the analysis of results. The Division of Bioengineering and Instrumentation will develop systems to monitor the body mass index, and the body composition, before and after the physical activity. The physical activity will be monitored using smartphones, to assess objectively the total daily activity levels in the children participating in the study. The Computer Graphics Division of the CREB will design a computer game that will automatically measure the attention of the children before and after the exercise. Researchers of this division have experience working with children as end-users, and have developed software to work on mobile devices. The Division of Biomedical Signals and Systems will participate in the integration and analysis of data using statistical methods, including: longitudinal analysis in consecutive measurements of biomarkers, training of nonlinear multivariate predictive models and integration of data from omics platforms. The results of this study could be used for recommending specific programs of physical training in schools, aimed at improving cognitive skills and academic performance of students."
